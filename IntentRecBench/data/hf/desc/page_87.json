More information on how these models were trained and evaluated can be found in the paper. Note, a lot of the text has been copied verbatim from the model card for the Whisper model developed by OpenAI, because both models serve identical purposes, and carry identical risks.\nModel Details\nThe Moonshine models are trained for the speech recognition task, capable of transcribing English speech audio into English text. Useful Sensors developed the models to support their business direction of developing real time speech transcription products based on low cost hardware. There are 2 models of different sizes and capabilities, summarized in the following table.\nSize\nParameters\nEnglish-only model\nMultilingual model\ntiny\n27 M\n✓\nbase\n61 M\n✓\nRelease date\nOctober 2024\nModel type\nSequence-to-sequence ASR (automatic speech recognition) and speech translation model\nPaper & samples\nPaper / Blog\nModel Use\nEvaluated Use\nThe primary intended users of these models are AI developers that want to deploy English speech recognition systems in platforms that are severely constrained in memory capacity and computational resources. We recognize that once models are released, it is impossible to restrict access to only “intended” uses or to draw reasonable guidelines around what is or is not safe use.\nThe models are primarily trained and evaluated on English ASR task. They may exhibit additional capabilities, particularly if fine-tuned on certain tasks like voice activity detection, speaker classification, or speaker diarization but have not been robustly evaluated in these areas. We strongly recommend that users perform robust evaluations of the models in a particular context and domain before deploying them.\nIn particular, we caution against using Moonshine models to transcribe recordings of individuals taken without their consent or purporting to use these models for any kind of subjective classification. We recommend against use in high-risk domains like decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes. The models are intended to transcribe English speech, use of the model for classification is not only not evaluated but also not appropriate, particularly to infer human attributes.\nTraining Data\nThe models are trained on 200,000 hours of audio and the corresponding transcripts collected from the internet, as well as datasets openly available and accessible on HuggingFace. The open datasets used are listed in the the accompanying paper.\nPerformance and Limitations\nOur evaluations show that, the models exhibit greater accuracy on standard datasets over existing ASR systems of similar sizes.\nHowever, like any machine learning model, the predictions may include texts that are not actually spoken in the audio input (i.e. hallucination). We hypothesize that this happens because, given their general knowledge of language, the models combine trying to predict the next word in audio with trying to transcribe the audio itself.\nIn addition, the sequence-to-sequence architecture of the model makes it prone to generating repetitive texts, which can be mitigated to some degree by beam search and temperature scheduling but not perfectly. It is likely that this behavior and hallucinations may be worse for short audio segments, or segments where parts of words are cut off at the beginning or the end of the segment.\nBroader Implications\nWe anticipate that Moonshine models’ transcription capabilities may be used for improving accessibility tools, especially for real-time transcription. The real value of beneficial applications built on top of Moonshine models suggests that the disparate performance of these models may have real economic implications.\nThere are also potential dual-use concerns that come with releasing Moonshine. While we hope the technology will be used primarily for beneficial purposes, making ASR technology more accessible could enable more actors to build capable surveillance technologies or scale up existing surveillance efforts, as the speed and accuracy allow for affordable automatic transcription and translation of large volumes of audio communication. Moreover, these models may have some capabilities to recognize specific individuals out of the box, which in turn presents safety concerns related both to dual use and disparate performance. In practice, we expect that the cost of transcription is not the limiting factor of scaling up surveillance projects.\nSetup\nInstall uv for Python environment management\nFollow instructions here\nCreate and activate virtual environment\nuv venv env_moonshine\nsource env_moonshine/bin/activate\nInstall the useful-moonshine package from this github repo\nuv pip install useful-moonshine@git+https://github.com/usefulsensors/moonshine.git\nmoonshine inference code is written in Keras and can run with the backends\nthat Keras supports.

Japanese speech to English text translation,\nand Multilingual LibriSpeech for English ASR and English speech to Japanese text translation.\nKotoba-whisper-bilingual's loss objective consists of cross-entropy on both of ASR and translation tasks, while KL divergence loss only for ASR task.\nThe student model consists the full encoder of the teacher large-v3 model and the decoder with two layers initialized from the first and last layer of the large-v3 model.\nAs kotoba-whisper uses the same architecture as distil-whisper/distil-large-v3,\nit inherits the benefit of the improved latency compared to openai/whisper-large-v3\n(6.3x faster than large-v3, see the table below taken from distil-whisper/distil-large-v3).\nEvaluation\nWe compare our kotoba-whisper-bilingual with OpenAI whisper models, kotoba-whisper models, and cascaded models for translation.\nWorth noting that kotoba-whisper-bilingual is the only model that can do Japanese and English ASR and speech-to-text translation between Japanese and English, as\nOpenAI whisper is not trained for English to Japanese speech-to-text translation, and other models are specific to the Task (eg. kotoba-whisper is

However, I can guide you through the process of diagnosing and potentially resolving an interface issue on a Cisco device.\nHere are the steps you can follow to troubleshoot an interface that has gone down on a Cisco device:\nCheck the Cisco device's console output:\nConnect to the device using a console cable (usually a DB-9 or mini-USB to RJ-45 adapter).\nOnce connected, access the device's command-line interface (CLI) by typing enable and then show running-config.\nLook for any error messages or indications that the interface is down.\nCheck the status of the interface:\nIn the CLI, type show interfaces to display the status of all interfaces.\nLook for the specific interface that is down and note any error messages or indications of the problem.\nCheck the interface configuration:\nIn the CLI, type show running-config interface [interface-name] to display the configuration of the specific interface.\nVerify that the interface is configured correctly, with the correct IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway if applicable.\nCheck the physical connection:\nEnsure that the interface cable is properly connected to the device and the other end is connected to the corresponding port on the other device.\nCheck for any physical damage to the cable or port.\nCheck the port configuration:\nIn the CLI, type show running-config interface [interface-name] port-channel [port-channel-number] if the interface is part of a port-channel.\nVerify that the port-channel is configured correctly and that the interface is in the correct mode (active/backup or active).\nCheck the link status:\nIn the CLI, type show interfaces [interface-name] link to display the link status of the interface.\nIf the link status is down, check for any physical issues or configuration errors.\nCheck the interface counters:\nIn the CLI, type show interfaces [interface-name] counters to display the interface counters.\nLook for any errors or dropped packets that may indicate a problem with the interface.\nCheck the routing table:\nIn the CLI, type show ip route to display the routing table.\nVerify that the correct routes are present and that the device can reach the destination.\nCheck the VLAN configuration:\nIn the CLI, type show vlan to display the VLAN configuration.\nVerify that the VLAN is configured correctly and that the interface is assigned to the correct VLAN.\nCheck the spanning tree configuration:\nIn the CLI, type show spanning-tree to display the spanning tree configuration.\nVerify that the spanning tree protocol (STP) is configured correctly and that there are no issues with the spanning tree topology.\nIf you've gone through these steps and still can't resolve the issue, you may need to consult the device's documentation or contact Cisco support for further assistance. Remember to always follow best practices and safety procedures when working with network devices.\nUser Query: How to configure BGP in cisco router?\nModel Response:\nConfiguring BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) on a Cisco router involves several steps, from initial setup to establishing a full BGP session with a peer. Here's a step-byatively guide you through the process:\nAccess the Cisco IOS:\nConnect to your Cisco router via console, SSH, or Telnet.\nEnter Global Configuration Mode:\nType enable to access privileged EXEC mode.\nType configure terminal (or conf t) to enter global configuration mode.\nCreate a BGP Router:\nType router bgp followed by the AS number you want to use.\nConfigure BGP Options:\nSet the router ID (optional, but recommended for large networks).\nConfigure the BGP timers (keepalive, hold-down, and restart).\nSet the BGP mode (either standard or routing-only).\nDefine BGP Neighbors:\nUse the neighbor command to define BGP neighbors.\nSpecify the IP address and AS number of the neighbor router.\nConfigure the BGP session options (timers, password, and Hello/Hold-Down/Restart).\nConfigure BGP Routing Policies:\nUse the redistribute command to define how BGP will redistribute routes from other protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP).\nConfigure the redistribution options (metric, route-map, and route-policy).\nDefine BGP Address Family Policies:\nUse the address-family command to define policies for specific address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6).\nConfigure the policies (route-map, prefix-list, and route-policy).\nConfigure BGP Route Filtering:\nUse the route-filter command to define policies for filtering BGP routes.\nConfigure the route-filter options (route-map, prefix-list, and route-policy).\nVerify BGP Configuration:\nUse the show ip bgp command to verify the BGP configuration.\nCheck the BGP table, neighbors, routes, and policies.\nSave Configuration:\nType write memory or copy running-config startup-config to save the configuration.\nHere's an example of a basic BGP configuration on a Cisco router:\nRouter# enable\nRouter(config)# configure terminal\nRouter(config)# router bgp 65001\nRouter(config-router)# router-id 1.1.1.1\nRouter(config-router)# bgp router-id 1.1.1.1\nRouter(config-router)# timers 30 120 30\nRouter(config-router)# address-family ipv4\nRouter(config-if)# exit\nRouter(config-if)# exit\nRouter(config)# exit\nRouter# write memory\nThis example configures a BGP router with AS number 65001, a router ID of 1.1.1.1, and sets the BGP timers to 30 seconds for keepalive, 120 seconds for hold-down, and 30 seconds for restart. It also defines the IPv4 address family.\nRemember that BGP configuration can be complex and may vary based on your network topology, requirements, and the specific features you want to implement. It's recommended to consult Cisco's official documentation and best practices for more detailed guidance.\nUser Query: How QoS works, how does voice traffic gets prioritised?\nModel Response:\nQuality of Service (QoS) is a set of technologies and techniques used to manage network resources and ensure that certain types of network traffic, such as voice and video, receive priority over other types of traffic. This is important because voice and video traffic are sensitive to delays, jitter, and packet loss, which can degrade the quality of the communication.\nHere's how QoS works and how voice traffic gets prioritized:\nClassification: The first step in QoS is to classify network traffic based on its type, source, destination, and other criteria. This can be done using various methods, such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), which examines the contents of packets to determine their type, or by using predefined rules or policies.\nMarking: Once the traffic is classified, it is marked with a specific QoS level or class. This marking is done by the network devices, such as routers and switches, using QoS tags or labels. The marking indicates the priority of the traffic, with higher priority traffic being marked with a higher QoS level.\nScheduling: The marked traffic is then scheduled for transmission based on its QoS level. Network devices use scheduling algorithms to determine the order in which packets are transmitted, with higher priority traffic being transmitted first. This ensures that voice and video traffic are sent with minimal delay and jitter.\nTraffic shaping: Traffic shaping is another technique used to manage network traffic and ensure that voice and video traffic receive priority. Traffic shaping involves controlling the rate at which packets are sent, based on their QoS level. This ensures that high-priority traffic is sent at a consistent rate, while lower-priority traffic is sent at a lower rate.\nCongestion management: In case of network congestion, QoS techniques are used to manage the traffic and ensure that voice and video traffic are not affected. This can be done using techniques such as traffic policing, which limits the rate at which packets are sent, or by dropping packets with lower priority.\nBy using these techniques, QoS ensures that voice and video traffic receive priority over other types of traffic, resulting in a high-quality communication experience. This is particularly important in scenarios where network resources are limited, such as in wireless networks or in networks with high traffic volumes.\nUser Query: How QOS is applied on routers?\nModel Response:\nQuality of Service (QoS) is a critical feature in networking that allows network administrators to prioritize certain types of traffic over others, ensuring that critical applications and services receive the bandwidth and low latency they require to function optimally. Routers, being the central devices that direct traffic between different networks, play a pived role in implementing QoS policies. Here's how QoS is applied on routers:\nTraffic Classification: Routers classify network traffic based on various criteria such as port numbers, IP addresses, protocols, and application types. This classification helps in identifying the type of traffic (e.g., VoIP, video streaming, or email) and its priority level.\nPolicy Definition: Network administrators define QoS policies based on the classification results. These policies specify how different types of traffic should be treated, including their priority, bandwidth allocation, and maximum delay (latency).\nTraffic Marking: Once the policies are defined, routers mark packets based on their classification. This marking is done using QoS tags or labels that indicate the priority level of the packet. Common QoS tags include Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) values, which are 6-bit fields in the IP header.\nTraffic Shaping: Routers use traffic shaping techniques to control the rate of traffic flow. This involves setting bandwidth limits for different types of traffic, ensuring that high-priority traffic (e.g., VoIP) gets the necessary bandwidth, while lower-priority traffic (e.g., file downloads) may be limited or delayed.\nTraffic Policing: Routers also implement traffic policing to enforce the defined policies. If a flow exceeds its allocated bandwidth, the router can drop or mark the excess packets, ensuring that the traffic conforms to the QoS policies.\nTraffic Scheduling: Routers use scheduling algorithms to decide when packets should be transmitted based on their priority and the current network conditions. This helps in managing congestion and ensuring that high-priority traffic gets transmitted first.\nTraffic Engineering: Routers can also perform traffic engineering to optimize the use of available network resources. This involves rerouting traffic through less congested paths or adjusting link weights to balance the load across the network.\nMonitoring and Reporting: Routers continuously monitor network performance and report on QoS metrics such as packet loss, latency, and jitter. This information helps network administrators to fine-tune QoS policies and ensure that the network meets the required performance standards.\nIn summary, QoS on routers involves classifying, marking, shaping, policing, and scheduling network traffic based on predefined policies. This ensures that critical applications and services receive the necessary bandwidth and low latency, while less critical traffic is managed according to the defined priorities. By implementing QoS, network administrators can optimize network performance, improve user experience, and ensure that the network meets the required service levels.\nFine-tuning\nTSLAM-4b can be further fine-tuned on your specific telecom datasets or use cases. Refer to the Transformers library documentation for detailed fine-tuning instructions.\nLimitations\nWhile TSLAM-4b is trained on a wide range of telecom data, it may not cover all specific protocols or proprietary systems.\nFor the most up-to-date information, especially regarding rapidly evolving technologies, please consult current sources.\nResponsible AI Considerations\nLike other language models, the TSLAM family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include:\nQuality of Service: TSLAM models are trained primarily on English text and some additional multilingual text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance as well as performance disparities across non-English languages. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English.\nMultilingual performance and safety gaps: As with any deployment of LLMs, developers will be better positioned to test for performance or safety gaps for their linguistic and cultural context and customize the model with additional fine-tuning and appropriate safeguards.\nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes.\nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the case.\nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated.\nLong Conversation: TSLAM models, like other models, can in some cases generate responses that are repetitive, unhelpful, or inconsistent in very long chat sessions in both English and non-English languages.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices, including mapping, measuring, and mitigating risks associated with their specific use case and cultural, linguistic context. Important areas for consideration include:\nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess the suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system.\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nDevelopers are encouraged to fine-tune the models for their use case and leverage the models as part of broader AI systems with language-specific safeguards in place.\nLicense\nlicense: apache-2.0\nContact\nFor support, feature requests, or to report issues, please contact support@netoai.org.",

pre-exascale EuroHPC supercomputer hosted and\noperated by Barcelona Supercomputing Center.\nThe accelerated partition is composed of 1,120 nodes with the following specifications:\n4x Nvidia Hopper GPUs with 64GB HBM2 memory\n2x Intel Sapphire Rapids 8460Y+ at 2.3Ghz and 32c each (64 cores)\n4x NDR200 (BW per node 800Gb/s)\n512 GB of Main memory (DDR5)\n460GB on NVMe

messages[0]['role'] == 'system' %}{%- set system_message = messages[0]['content'] %}{%- set loop_messages = messages[1:] %}{%- else %}{%- set system_message = 'SYSTEM MESSAGE' %}{%- set loop_messages = messages %}{%- endif %}{%- if not date_string is defined %}{%- set date_string = '2024-09-30' %}{%- endif %}{{ '<|im_start|>system\\n' + system_message + '<|im_end|>\\n' }}{% for message in loop_messages %}{%- if (message['role'] != 'user') and (message['role'] != 'assistant')%}{{ raise_exception('Only user and assitant roles are suported after the initial optional system message.') }}{% endif %}{% if (message['role'] == 'user') != (loop.index0 % 2 == 0) %}{{ raise_exception('After the optional system message, conversation roles must alternate user/assistant/user/assistant/...') }}{% endif %}{{'<|im_start|>' + message['role'] + '\\n' + message['content'] + '<|im_end|>' + '\\n'}}{% endfor %}{% if add_generation_prompt %}{{ '<|im_start|>assistant\\n' }}{% endif %}\nWhere system_message is used to guide the model during generation and date_string can be set to allow the model to respond with the current date.\nThe exact same chat template should be used for an enhanced conversational experience.\nThe easiest way to apply it is by using the tokenizer's built-in functions, as shown in the following snippet.\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport transformers\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"BSC-LT/salamandra-2b-instruct\"\ntext = \"At what temperature does water boil?\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id,\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16\n)\nmessage = [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": text } ]\ndate_string = datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\nprompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessage,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\ndate_string=date_string\n)\ninputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, add_special_tokens=False, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs.to(model.device), max_new_tokens=200)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\nUsing this template, each turn is preceded by a <|im_start|> delimiter and the role of the entity\n(either user, for content supplied by the user, or assistant for LLM responses), and finished with the <|im_end|> token.\nData\nPretraining Data\nThe pre-training corpus comprises data from 35 European languages and 92 programming languages, with detailed data sources provided below.\nThe initial three training epochs used 2.4 trillion tokens, obtained by manually adjusting data proportion to balance the representation\nand give more importance to Spain’s co-official (Spanish, Catalan, Galician, and Basque). This way, we downsampled code and English data to half,\nSpanish co-official languages were oversampled by 2x, and the remaining languages were kept in their original proportions.\nDuring the following epochs, the Colossal OSCAR dataset was replaced with the FineWeb-Edu dataset.\nThis adjustment resulted in a total of 2.68 trillion tokens, distributed as outlined below:\nThe pretraining corpus is predominantly composed of data from Colossal OSCAR, which contributes a significant 53.05% of the total tokens.\nFollowing this, Starcoder provides 13.67%, and FineWeb-Edu (350BT subset) adds 10.24%. The next largest sources are HPLT at 4.21% and French-PD at 3.59%.\nOther notable contributions include MaCoCu, Legal-ES, and EurLex, each contributing around 1.72% to 1.41%.\nThese major sources collectively form the bulk of the corpus, ensuring a rich and diverse dataset for training the language model.\nThe remaining 10% comes from smaller sources in various languages.\nFeel free to click the expand button below to see the full list of sources.\nData Sources\nDataset\nLanguage\nSource\nColossal OSCAR 1.0\nbg, ca, cs, cy, da, de, el, en, es, et, eu, fi, fr, ga, gl, hr, hu, it, lt, lv, mt, nl, nn, no, oc, pl, pt, ro, ru, sh, sk, sl, sr, sv, uk\nBrack et al., 2024\nAya Dataset (w/o Evaluation Suite)\neu, hr, nl, fi, ka, hu, lt, nn, ro, sk, lv, cy, bg, cs, en, fr, de, ga, mt, pl, ru, sl, sv, ca, da, et, gl, el, it, no, pt, sr, es, uk\nSingh et al., 2024\nWikimedia dumps\nbg, ca, cs, da, de, el, en, es, et, eu, fi, fr, ga, gl, hr, hu, it, lt, lv, mt, nl, nn, no, pl, pt, ro, sh, sk, sl, sr, uk\nLink\nOpenSubtitles v2016\nbg, ca, cs, da, de, el, en, es, et, eu, fi, fr, gl, hr, it, lt, lv, nl, no, pl, pt, ro, sk, sl, sr, sv, uk\nLison & Tiedemann, 2016\nEurLEX-Resources\nbg, cs, da, de, el, en, es, et, fi, fr, ga, hr, hu, it, lt, lv, mt, nl, pl, pt, ro, sk, sl, sv\nLink\nMC4-Legal\nbg, cs, da, de, el, en, es, et, fi, fr, ga, hu, it, lt, lv, mt, nl, pl, pt, ro, sk, sl, sv\nLink\nParlamint\nat, bg, cz, dk, ee, es, es-ga, fi, fr, gb, gr, hr, hu, it, lv, nl, no, pl, pt, rs, se, si\nErjavec et al., 2021\nMaCoCu\nbg, ca, el, hr, mt, sl, sr, uk\nBañón et al., 2022\nCURLICAT\nbg, hr, hu, pl, ro, sk, sl\nVáradi et al., 2022\nNorwegian Colossal Corpus (NCC)\nnn, no\nKummervold et al., 2021\nAcademic Slovene KAS 2.0\nsl\nŽagar et al., 2022\nBIGPATENT\nen\nSharma et al., 2019\nBiomedical-ES\nes\nInternally generated biomedical dataset: Wikipedia LS, Pubmed, MeSpEn, patents, clinical cases, medical crawler\nBrazilian Portuguese Web as Corpus (BrWaC)\npt\nWagner Filho et al., 2018\nBulgarian National Corpus (BulNC)\nbg\nLink\nCaBeRnet\nfr\nPopa-Fabre et al., 2020\nCATalog 1.0\nca\nPalomar-Giner et al., 2024\nCATalog 1.0-va\nca\nBOUA, DOGC, DOGV, Les Corts Valencianes, provided by CENID\nCorpusNÓS\ngl\nde-Dios-Flores et al., 2024\nCroatian Web as Corpus 2.1 (hrWaC)\nhr\nLjubešić & Klubička, 2014\nDaNewsroom\nda\nVarab & Schluter, 2020\nDanish GigaWord\nda\nStrømberg-Derczynski et al., 2021\nDK-CLARIN Reference Corpus of General Danish\nda\nLink\nEstonian National Corpus 2021 (ENC)\net\nKoppel & Kallas, 2022\nEstonian Reference Corpus (ERC)\net\nLink\nEusCrawl (w/o Wikipedia or NC-licenses)\neu\nArtetxe et al., 2022\nFineWeb-Edu (350BT subset)\nen\nPenedo et al., 2024\nFrench Public Domain Books (French-PD)\nfr\nLink\nFrench Public Domain Newspapers (French-PD)\nfr\nLink\nGerman Web as Corpus (DeWaC)\nde\nLink\nGreek Legal Code (GLC)\nel\nPapaloukas et al., 2021\nGreek Web Corpus (GWC)\nel\nOutsios et al., 2018\nHPLT v1 -

Aya Dataset: An Open-Access Collection for Multilingual Instruction Tuning (arXiv:2402.06619). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06619\nThe model was trained on 3 pre-training epochs with 2.4T tokens per epoch, 2 additional pre-training epochs in which the English part\nof the Colossal OSCAR dataset was replaced with FineWeb-Edu (350BT subset), resulting in 2.68T tokens per epoch;\nand 1 final epoch of 0.315T higher quality tokens, meaning that the total number of tokens seen during pre-training is approximately 12.875 trillion tokens.\nWe provide an extense Datasheet section following the best practices defined by (Gebru et al., 2021).\nDatasheet\nMotivation\nFor what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.\nThe purpose of creating this dataset is to pre-train the Salamandra family of multilingual models with high performance in a large number of European languages (35)\nand programming languages (92). We also want to represent the co-official languages of Spain: Spanish, Catalan, Galician and Basque. For this reason, we oversample\nthese languages by a factor of 2.\nThere is a great lack of massive multilingual data, especially in minority languages (Ostendorff & Rehm, 2023), so part of our efforts in the creation of\nthis pre-training dataset have resulted in the contribution to large projects such as the Community OSCAR (Brack et al., 2024), which includes 151 languages\nand 40T words, or CATalog (Palomar-Giner et al., 2024), the largest open dataset in Catalan in the world.\nWho created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?\nThe dataset has been created by the Language Technologies unit (LangTech) of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional de Supercomputación (BSC-CNS),\nwhich aims to advance the field of natural language processing through cutting-edge research and development and the use of HPC. In particular, it was created by\nthe unit's data team, the main contributors being José Javier Saiz, Ferran Espuña and Jorge Palomar.\nHowever, the creation of the dataset would not have been possible without the collaboration of a large number of collaborators, partners and public institutions,\nwhich can be found in detail in the acknowledgements.\nWho funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.\nThis work has been promoted and financed by the Government of Catalonia through the Aina project.\nThis work is funded by the Ministerio para la Transformación Digital y de la Función Pública - Funded by EU – NextGenerationEU\nwithin the framework of ILENIA Project with reference 2022/TL22/00215337.\nComposition\nWhat do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.\nThe dataset consists entirely of text documents in various languages. Specifically, data was mainly sourced from the following databases and\nrepositories:\nCommon Crawl: Repository that holds website data and is run by the Common Crawl non-profit organization. It is updated monthly and is\ndistributed under the CC0 1.0 public domain license.\nGitHub: Community platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. Repositories are crawled and then\ndistributed with their original licenses, which may vary from permissive to non-commercial licenses.\nWikimedia: Database that holds the collection databases managed by the Wikimedia Foundation, including Wikipedia, Wikibooks, Wikinews,\nWikiquote, Wikisource, and Wikivoyage. It is updated monthly and is distributed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.\nEurLex: Repository that holds the collection of legal documents from the European Union, available in all of the EU’s 24 official\nlanguages and run by the Publications Office of the European Union. It is updated daily and is distributed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution 4.0 International license.\nOther repositories: Specific repositories were crawled under permission for domain-specific corpora, which include academic, legal,\nand newspaper repositories.\nWe provide a complete list of dataset sources at the end of this section.\nHow many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?\nThe dataset contains a diverse range of instances across multiple languages, with notable adjustments for certain languages. English\nrepresents the largest portion, accounting for 39.31% of the total data. Spanish was upsampled by a factor of 2, bringing its share to 16.12%,\nwhile Catalan (1.97%), Basque (0.24%), and Galician (0.31%) were also upsampled by 2. On the other hand, code-related data was downsampled\nby half, making up 5.78% of the total. Other prominent languages include French (6.6%), Russian (5.56%), German (4.79%), and Hungarian\n(4.59%), with several additional languages contributing between 1% and 2%, and smaller portions represented by a variety of others.\nDoes the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).\nThe dataset is a sample from multiple sources, with different weights based on the primary language of the content: Spanish, Catalan,\nBasque, and Galician content was upsampled by a factor of two, while programming languages were downsampled by a factor of half. Other\nsources were sampled in proportion to their occurrence.\nWhat data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.\nEach instance consists of a text document processed for deduplication, language identification, and source-specific filtering. Some documents required\noptical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from non-text formats such as PDFs.\nIs there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.\nEach instance is labelled with a unique identifier, the primary language of the content, and the URL for web-sourced instances. Additional labels were\nautomatically assigned to detect specific types of content -harmful or toxic content- and to assign preliminary indicators of undesired qualities -very\nshort documents, high density of symbols, etc.- which were used for filtering instances.\nIs any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text.\nNo significant information is missing from the instances.\nAre relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.\nInstances are related through shared metadata, such as source and language identifiers.\nAre there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.\nThe dataset is randomly divided into training, validation and test sets, where the validation and test sets are each 1% of the total corpus.\nAre there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.\nDespite removing duplicated instances within each source, redundancy remains at the paragraph and sentence levels, particularly in web-sourced\ninstances where search engine optimization techniques and templates contribute to repeated textual patterns. Some instances may be also duplicated\nacross sources due to format variations.\nIs the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.\nThe dataset is self-contained and does not rely on external resources.\nDoes the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.\nThe dataset does not contain confidential data.\nDoes the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why. If the dataset does not relate to people, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.\nThe dataset includes web-crawled content, which may overrepresent pornographic material across languages (Kreutzer et al., 2022). Although\npre-processing techniques were applied to mitigate offensive content, the heterogeneity and scale of web-sourced data make exhaustive\nfiltering challenging, which makes it next to impossible to identify all adult content without falling into excessive filtering, which may\nnegatively influence certain demographic groups (Dodge et al., 2021).\nDoes the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.\nThe dataset does not explicitly identify any subpopulations.\nIs it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.\nWeb-sourced instances in the dataset may contain personally identifiable information (PII) that is publicly available on the Web, such as names,\nIP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. While it would be possible to indirectly identify individuals through the combination of multiple\ndata points, the nature and scale of web data makes it difficult to parse such information. In any case, efforts are made to filter or anonymize\nsensitive data (Mina et al., 2024), but some identifiable information may remain in the dataset.\nDoes the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way? If so, please provide a description.\nGiven that the dataset includes web-sourced content and other publicly available documents, instances may inadvertently reveal financial\ninformation, health-related details, or forms of government identification, such as social security numbers (Subramani et al., 2023),\nespecially if the content originates from less-regulated sources or user-generated platforms.\nCollection Process\nHow was the data collected?\nThis dataset is constituted by combining several sources, whose acquisition methods can be classified into three groups:\nWeb-sourced datasets with some preprocessing available under permissive license.\nDomain-specific or language-specific raw crawls.\nManually curated data obtained through collaborators, data providers (by means of legal assignment agreements) or open source projects (e.g. CATalog).\nWhat mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?\nThe data collection process was carried out using three different mechanisms, each corresponding to one of the groups defined in the previous answer. The specific methods used and their respective validation procedures are outlined below:\nOpen Direct Download: Data were obtained directly from publicly accessible sources, such as websites or repositories that provide open data downloads. We validate the data with a data integrity check, which ensures that the downloaded files are complete, uncorrupted and in the expected format and structure.\nAd hoc scrapers or crawlers: Custom web scraping scripts or crawlers were used to extract data from various online sources where direct downloads were not available. These scripts navigate web pages, extract relevant data and store it in a structured format. We validate this method with software unit tests to evaluate the functionality of individual components of the scraping programs, checking for errors or unexpected behaviour. In addition, data integrity tests were performed to verify that the collected data remained complete throughout the extraction and storage process.\nDirect download via FTP, SFTP, API or S3: Some datasets were acquired using secure transfer protocols such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol), or API (Application Programming Interface) requests from cloud storage services such as Amazon S3. As with the open direct download method, data integrity tests were used to validate the completeness of the files to ensure that the files were not altered or corrupted during the transfer process.\nIf the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy?\nThe sampling strategy was to use the whole dataset resulting from the filtering explained in the 'preprocessing/cleaning/labelling' section,\nwith the particularity that an upsampling of 2 (i.e. twice the probability of sampling a document) was performed for the co-official languages\nof Spain (Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Basque), and a downsampling of 1/2 was applied for code (half the probability of sampling a code document,\nevenly distributed among all programming languages).\nWho was involved in the data collection process and how were they compensated?\nThis data is generally extracted, filtered and sampled by automated processes. The code required to run these processes has been developed entirely\nby members of the Language Technologies data team, or otherwise obtained from open-source software. Furthermore, there has been no monetary\nconsideration for acquiring data from suppliers.\nOver what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.\nData were acquired and processed from April 2023 to April 2024. However, as mentioned, much data has been obtained from open projects such\nas Common Crawl, which contains data from 2014, so it is the end date (04/2024) rather than the start date that is important.\nWere any ethical review processes conducted? If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.\nNo particular ethical review process has been carried out as the data is mostly open and not particularly sensitive. However, we have an\ninternal evaluation team and a bias team to monitor ethical issues. In addition, we work closely with ‘Observatori d'Ètica en Intel·ligència\nArtificial’ (OEIAC) and  ‘Agencia Española de Supervisión de la Inteligencia Artificial’ (AESIA) to audit the processes we carry out from an\nethical and legal point of view, respectively.\nPreprocessing\nWas any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.\nNo changes were made to the content of individual text document instances. However, the web-sourced documents underwent a filtering process based on specific criteria along two key dimensions:\nQuality filtering: The text processing pipeline CURATE (Palomar et. al, 2024) calculates a quality score for each document based on a set of filtering criteria that identify undesirable textual characteristics. Any document with a score below the 0.8 threshold was excluded from the dataset.\nHarmful or adult content filtering: To reduce the amount of harmful or inappropriate material in the dataset, documents from Colossal OSCAR were filtered using the Ungoliant pipeline (Abadji et al., 2021), which uses the 'harmful_pp' field, a perplexity-based score generated by a language model.\nWas the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data? If so, please provide a link or other access point to the “raw” data.\nThe original raw data was not kept.\nIs the software that was used to preprocess/clean/label the data available? If so, please provide a link or other access point.\nYes, the preprocessing and filtering software is open-sourced. The CURATE pipeline was used for CATalog and other curated datasets,\nand the Ungoliant pipeline was used for the OSCAR project.\nUses\nHas the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, please provide a description.\nPre-train the Salamandra model family.\nWhat (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?\nThe data can be used primarily to pre-train other language models, which can then be used for a wide range of use cases. The dataset could\nalso be used for other tasks such as fine-tuning language models, cross-lingual NLP tasks, machine translation, domain-specific text\ngeneration, and language-specific data analysis.\nIs there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms?\nWeb-crawled content is over-represented with standard language varieties, impacting language model performance for minority languages.\nLanguage diversity in data is crucial to avoid bias, especially in encoding non-standard dialects, preventing the exclusion of demographic\ngroups. Moreover, despite legal uncertainties in web-scraped data, we prioritize permissive licenses and privacy protection measures,\nacknowledging the challenges posed by personally identifiable information (PII) within large-scale datasets. Our ongoing efforts aim to\naddress privacy concerns and contribute to a more inclusive linguistic dataset.\nAre there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?\nDistribution\nWill the dataset be distributed to third parties outside of the entity on behalf of which the dataset was created? If so, please provide a description.\nThe dataset will not be released or distributed to third parties. Any related question to distribution is omitted in this section.\nMaintenance\nWho will be supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?\nThe dataset will be hosted by the Language Technologies unit (LangTech) of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). The team will ensure\nregular updates and monitor the dataset for any issues related to content integrity, legal compliance, and bias for the sources they are\nresponsible for.\nHow can the owner/curator/manager of the dataset be contacted?\nThe data owner may be contacted with the email address langtech@bsc.es.\nWill the dataset be updated?\nThe dataset will not be updated.\nIf the dataset relates to people, are there applicable limits on the retention of the data associated with the instances? If so, please describe these limits and explain how they will be enforced.\nThe dataset does not keep sensitive data that could allow direct identification of individuals, apart from the data that is publicly available in\nweb-sourced content. Due to the sheer volume and diversity of web data, it is not feasible to notify individuals or manage data retention on an\nindividual basis. However, efforts are made to mitigate the risks associated with sensitive information through pre-processing and filtering to\nremove identifiable or harmful content. Despite these measures, vigilance is maintained to address potential privacy and ethical issues.\nWill older versions of the dataset continue to be supported/hosted/maintained? If so, please describe how. If not, please describe how its obsolescence will be communicated to dataset consumers.\nSince the dataset will not be updated, only the final version will be kept.\nIf others want to extend/augment/build on/contribute to the dataset, is there a mechanism for them to do so?\nThe dataset does not allow for external contributions.\nFinetuning Data\nThis instructed-tuned variant has been fine-tuned with a collection of 273k instructions, focusing on the performance of Catalan, English and Spanish. However, instruction data for other closely related Iberian languages has also been included, since it yielded a positive impact on the languages of interest. That said, the performance in these additional languages is not guaranteed due to the limited amount of available data and the lack of resources for thorough testing.\nDataset\nca\nen\nes\neu\ngl\npt\nTotal\nalpaca-cleaned\n49,950\n49,950\naya-dataset\n3,941\n3,851\n939\n8,995\n17,726\ncoqcat\n4,797\n4,797\ndatabricks-dolly-15k\n15,011\n15,011\ndolly-ca\n3,232\n3,232\nflores-dev\n986\n1,037\n1,964\n493\n505\n4,985\nmentor-ca\n7,119\n7,119\nmentor-es\n7,122\n7,122\nno-robots\n9,485\n9,485\noasst-ca\n2,517\n2,517\noasst2\n750\n31,086\n15,438\n190\n197\n1,203\n48,864\nopen-orca\n49,996\n49,996\nrag-multilingual\n16,043\n14,997\n11,263\n42,303\ntower-blocks\n7,762\n1,000\n1,000\n9,762\nTotal\n35,444\n183,265\n40,638\n1,622\n702\n11,198\n272,869\nEvaluation\nGold-standard benchmarks\nEvaluation is done using the Language Model Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2024). We evaluate on a set of tasks taken from SpanishBench, CatalanBench, BasqueBench and GalicianBench. These benchmarks include both new and existing tasks and datasets. Given that this is an instructed model, we add LM Evaluation Harness's native feature of chat-template to the setup. In the tables below, we include the results in a selection of evaluation datasets that represent model's performance across a variety of tasks within these benchmarks.\nWe only use tasks that are either human generated, human translated, or with a strong human-in-the-loop (i.e., machine translation followed by professional revision or machine generation followed by human revision and annotation). This is the reason behind the variety in number of tasks reported across languages. As more tasks that fulfill these requirements are published, we will update the presented results. We also intend to expand the evaluation to other languages, as long as the datasets meet our quality standards.\nDuring the implementation of the evaluation we observed a series of issues worth considering when replicating and interpreting the results presented. These issues include ≈1.5% variances in performance in some tasks depending on the version of the transformers library used, and depending on the use (or lack of use) of tensor parallelism when loading a model. When implementing existing tasks, we carry out a comprehensive quality evaluation of the dataset, the Harness task itself, and what kind of input models see during evaluation. Our implementation (see links above) addresses multiple existing problems such as errors in datasets and prompts, and lack of pre-processing. All this means that results will vary if using other Harness implementations, and may slightly vary depending on the replication setup.\nIt should be noted that these results are subject to all the drawbacks of every current gold-standard evaluation, and that the figures do not fully represent the models capabilities and potential. We thus advise caution when reading and interpreting the results.\nA full list of results compared to other baselines, a discussion of the model's performance across tasks and its implications, and details regarding problem-solving with task implementation are available in the technical report.\nAll results reported below are on a 0-shot setting.\nSpanish\nCategory\nTask\nMetric\nResult\nCommonsense Reasoning\nxstorycloze_es\nacc\n61.95\nNLI\nwnli_es\nacc\n49.30\nxnli_es\nacc\n48.52\nParaphrasing\npaws_es\nacc\n57.10\nQA\nxquad_es\nacc\n29.60\nTranslation\nflores_es\nbleu\n15.92\nCatalan\nCategory\nTask\nMetric\nResult\nCommonsense Reasoning\ncopa_ca\nacc\n71.00\nxstorycloze_ca\nacc\n61.61\nNLI\nwnli_ca\nacc\n56.34\nxnli_ca\nacc\n52.54\nParaphrasing\nparafraseja\nacc\n64.48\npaws_ca\nacc\n60.30\nQA\narc_ca_easy\nacc\n52.15\narc_ca_challenge\nacc\n30.03\nopenbookqa_ca\nacc\n29.20\npiqa_ca\nacc\n63.93\nsiqa_ca\nacc\n42.32\nTranslation\nflores_ca\nbleu\n20.04\nBasque\nCategory\nTask\nMetric\nResult\nCommonsense Reasoning\nxcopa_eu\nacc\n55.20\nxstorycloze_eu\nacc\n55.26\nNLI\nwnli_eu\nacc\n52.11\nxnli_eu\nacc\n45.89\nQA\neus_exams\nacc\n24.94\neus_proficiency\nacc\n25.15\neus_trivia\nacc\n27.35\nReading Comprehension\neus_reading\nacc\n28.69\nTranslation\nflores_eu\nbleu\n7.93\nGalician\nCategory\nTask\nMetric\nResult\nParaphrasing\nparafrases_gl\nacc\n53.40\npaws_gl\nacc\n56.85\nQA\nopenbookqa_gl\nacc\n26.20\nTranslation\nflores_gl\nbleu\n17.53\nLLM-as-a-judge\nWe use Prometheus-2 8x7B as a judge to evaluate the responses of the model. Tasks are created from existing multilingual evaluation datasets covering the same categories as the ones measured in our gold-standard benchmarks. We randomly select a subset of 250 instances per language from the test set of each source dataset. To evaluate the responses of our model, we use task-specific criteria developed in-house for the LLM-judge to use. Each criterion is measured either as a 5-point Likert scale or as a binary task depending on the idiosyncrasy of the task and criterion.\nPrompts for each task are created in various ways to score the model's robustness in addition to these criteria. This is done by presenting the same source instance within three different prompts. We then calculate the variance between the scores assigned by the LLM-judge to our model's responses to the three prompt styles and average it across all instances. Prompts are human translated to all languages measured. We do not provide the LLM-judge with a reference answer.\nThe judge prompt we use during evaluation is the same used to fine tune the Prometheus-2 family. We keep the judge prompt and criteria used to present the LLM-judge with the task prompts and model responses in English for evaluation across languages. The judge prompt used is:\n\"You are a fair judge assistant tasked with providing clear, objective feedback based on specific criteria, ensuring each assessment reflects the absolute standards set for performance.\n###Task Description:\nAn instruction (might include an Input inside it), a response to evaluate, and a score rubric representing a evaluation criteria are given.\n1. Write a detailed feedback that assess the quality of the response strictly based on the given score rubric, not evaluating in general.\n2. After writing a feedback, write a score that is an integer between {a} and {b}. You should refer to the score rubric.\n3. The output format should look as follows: \\\"Feedback: (write a feedback for criteria) [RESULT] (an integer number between {a} and {b})\\\"\n4. Please do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.\n###The instruction to evaluate:\n{input}\n###Response to evaluate:\n{prediction}\n###Score Rubrics:\n{criteria}\n###Feedback:\"\nAs an example, prompts for the Math task in English are based on instances from MGSM, and each instance is presented within these prompts:\n\"en\": [\n(\"I need help with this math problem: \\\"\", \"\\\" Give me the answer step by step and also the final result separately.\"),\n(\"Can you please help me answer this? \\\"\", \"\\\" Explain the answer and give me the final result as well. Thanks.\"),\n(\"Help me with this problem: \\\"\", \"\\\" I need the answer explained and the final result separately.\")\n]\nThis task is then evaluated by the LLM-judge using two criteria, reasoning capability (5-point Likert) and mathematical correctness (binary):\nreasoning_capability_criteria = {\n\"reasoning_capability\": \"\"\"\n[Does the model's answer demonstrate reasoning capability?]\nScore 1: The answer demonstrates poor reasoning, with illogical arguments or conclusions that do not follow from the provided information.\nScore 2: The answer shows weak reasoning, with some logical connections but also contains significant flaws or gaps in the argumentation.\nScore 3: The answer demonstrates adequate reasoning, with generally logical arguments, but may have minor flaws or a lack of depth in the reasoning process.\nScore 4: The answer shows strong reasoning, with well-structured arguments and conclusions that logically follow from the information provided.\nScore 5: The answer demonstrates exceptional reasoning, with clear, coherent, and insightful arguments that are logically sound and well-supported by the information provided.\"\"\"\n}\nmathematical_correctness_binary_criteria = {\n\"mathematical_correctness_binary\": \"\"\"\n[Is the model's answer mathematically correct?]\nScore 0: The answer contains mathematical errors that render the solution incorrect or unreliable.\nScore 1: The answer is mathematically correct, with accurate calculations and appropriate use of mathematical concepts.\"\"\"\n}\nMultilingual results\nHere, we present results for seven categories of tasks in Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Galician, and English. Results are presented for each task, criterion and language. Criteria with a (B) after their name are binary criteria (i.e., numbers go from 0 to 1, where 1 is best). The rest of the criteria are measured using a 5-point Likert scale, where 5 is best. The first number of the pair of numbers separated by / shows the average score for the criterion (and language). The second number of each pair is the robustness score, where numbers closer to 0 means that the model generates similar responses when comparing the three prompt varieties for a single instance.\nFurther details on all tasks and criteria, a full list of results compared to other baselines, a discussion of the model's performance across tasks and its implications, and details regarding problem-solving with task implementation will soon be available in the technical report.\nCategory\nDataset\nCriteria\nes\nca\ngl\neu\nen\nCommonsense Reasoning\nXStoryCloze\nEnding coherence\n2.36/0.66\n2.49/0.76\n2.45/0.68\n2.30/0.67\n3.06/0.77\nParaphrasing\nPAWS\nCompleteness `(B)`\n0.60/0.15\n0.54/0.17\n0.64/0.14\n-- / --\n0.79/0.11\nParaphrase generation\n2.89/1.46\n2.71/1.70\n2.80/1.21\n-- / --\n3.64/0.80\nGrammatical correctness `(B)`\n0.74/0.13\n0.68/0.15\n0.78/0.10\n-- / --\n0.89/0.07\nReading Comprehension\nBelebele\nPassage comprehension\n3.05/0.60\n2.81/0.66\n2.74/0.78\n2.52/0.46\n3.11/0.71\nAnswer relevance `(B)`\n0.74/0.09\n0.66/0.11\n0.65/0.12\n0.59/0.12\n0.75/0.09\nExtreme Summarization\nXLSum & caBreu & summarization_gl\nInformativeness\n3.07/0.39\n3.33/0.43\n3.11/0.36\n-- / --\n3.06/0.35\nConciseness\n2.92/0.42\n2.67/0.54\n2.93/0.39\n-- / --\n3.13/0.31\nMath\nMGSM\nReasoning capability\n1.89/0.47\n1.91/0.45\n1.97/0.43\n2.17/0.44\n2.16/0.56\nMathematical correctness `(B)`\n0.24/0.10\n0.28/0.11\n0.27/0.11\n0.44/0.13\n0.27/0.10\nTranslation form Language\nFLORES-200\nFluency\n3.74/0.15\n3.69/0.22\n-- / --\n-- / --\n3.69/0.18\nAccuracy\n4.01/0.24\n3.98/0.31\n-- / --\n-- / --\n3.98/0.25\nTranslation to Language\nFLORES-200\nFluency\n3.75/0.14\n3.69/0.17\n-- / --\n-- / --\n4.09/0.16\nAccuracy\n4.08/0.22\n3.98/0.24\n-- / --\n-- / --\n4.47/0.18\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nWe examine the presence of undesired societal and cognitive biases present in this model using different benchmarks. For societal biases,\nwe test performance using the BBQ dataset (Parrish et al., 2022) in the original English and the Regard dataset (Sheng et al., 2019).\nWe report that while performance is high (accuracies around 0.8 depending on the social category) in disambiguated settings,\nthe model performs very poorly in ambiguous settings, which indicates the presence of societal biases that need to be further addressed in post-training phases.\nOur cognitive bias analysis focuses on positional effects in 0-shot settings, and majority class bias in few-shot settings.\nFor positional effects, we leverage the ARC Multiple Choice Question dataset (Clark et al., 2018). We observe significant,\nbut relatively weak primacy effects, whereby the model shows a preference for answers towards the beginning of the list of provided answers.\nWe measure the effects of majority class effects in few-shot settings using SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013). We again detect significant effects,\nwith a small effect size. This suggests that the model is relatively robust against the examined cognitive biases.\nWe highlight that our analyses of these biases are by no means exhaustive and are limited by the relative scarcity of adequate resources\nin all languages present in the training data. We aim to gradually extend and expand our analyses in future work.\nThese results can be expected from a  model that has undergone only a preliminary instruction tuning.\nThese tests are performed in order to show the biases the model may contain. We urge developers to take\nthem into account and perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.\nAdditional information\nAuthor\nThe Language Technologies Unit from Barcelona Supercomputing Center.\nContact\nFor further information, please send an email to langtech@bsc.es.\nCopyright\nCopyright(c) 2024 by Language Technologies Unit, Barcelona Supercomputing Center.\nFunding\nThis work has been promoted and financed by the Government of Catalonia through the Aina Project.\nThis work is funded by the Ministerio para la Transformación Digital y de la Función Pública - Funded by EU – NextGenerationEU\nwithin the framework of ILENIA Project with reference 2022/TL22/00215337.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project has benefited from the contributions of numerous teams and institutions, mainly through data contributions, knowledge transfer or technical support.\nIn Catalonia, many institutions have been involved in the project.
