It is a reasoning model that is post trained for reasoning, human chat preferences, and tasks, such as RAG and tool calling.\nLlama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1 is a model which offers a great tradeoff between model accuracy and efficiency. It is created from Llama 3.1 8B Instruct and offers improvements in model accuracy. The model fits on a single RTX GPU and can be used locally. The model supports a context length of 128K.\nThis model underwent a multi-phase post-training process to enhance both its reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. This includes a supervised fine-tuning stage for Math, Code, Reasoning, and Tool Calling as well as multiple reinforcement learning (RL) stages using REINFORCE (RLOO) and Online Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) algorithms for both chat and instruction-following. The final model checkpoint is obtained after merging the final SFT and Online RPO checkpoints. Improved using Qwen.\nThis model is part of the Llama Nemotron Collection.

Reasoning mode (ON/OFF) is controlled via system prompt. Please see the example below.\nOur code requires the transformers package version to be 4.44.2 or higher.\nExample of “Reasoning On:”\nimport torch\nimport transformers\nmodel_id = \"nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1\"\nmodel_kwargs = {\"torch_dtype\": torch.bfloat16, \"device_map\": \"auto\"}\ntokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\ntokenizer.pad_token_id = tokenizer.eos_token_id\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n\"text-generation\",\nmodel=model_id,\ntokenizer=tokenizer,\nmax_new_tokens=32768,\ntemperature=0.6,\ntop_p=0.95,\n**model_kwargs\n)\n# Thinking can be \"on\" or \"off\"\nthinking = \"on\"\nprint(pipeline([{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": f\"detailed thinking {thinking}\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Solve x*(sin(x)+2)=0\"}]))\nExample of “Reasoning Off:”\nimport torch\nimport transformers\nmodel_id = \"nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1\"\nmodel_kwargs = {\"torch_dtype\": torch.bfloat16, \"device_map\": \"auto\"}\ntokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\ntokenizer.pad_token_id = tokenizer.eos_token_id\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n\"text-generation\",\nmodel=model_id,\ntokenizer=tokenizer,\nmax_new_tokens=32768,\ndo_sample=False,\n**model_kwargs\n)\n# Thinking can be \"on\" or \"off\"\nthinking = \"off\"\nprint(pipeline([{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": f\"detailed thinking {thinking}\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Solve x*(sin(x)+2)=0\"}]))\nFor some prompts, even though thinking is disabled, the model emergently prefers to think before responding. But if desired, the users can prevent it by pre-filling the assistant response.\nimport torch\nimport transformers\nmodel_id = \"nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1\"\nmodel_kwargs = {\"torch_dtype\": torch.bfloat16, \"device_map\": \"auto\"}\ntokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\ntokenizer.pad_token_id = tokenizer.eos_token_id\n# Thinking can be \"on\" or \"off\"\nthinking = \"off\"\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n\"text-generation\",\nmodel=model_id,\ntokenizer=tokenizer,\nmax_new_tokens=32768,\ndo_sample=False,\n**model_kwargs\n)\nprint(pipeline([{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": f\"detailed thinking {thinking}\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Solve x*(sin(x)+2)=0\"}, {\"role\":\"assistant\", \"content\":\"<think>\\n</think>\"}]))\nInference:\nEngine: Transformers\nTest Hardware:\nBF16:\n1x RTX 50 Series GPUs\n1x RTX 40 Series GPUs\n1x RTX 30 Series GPUs\n1x H100-80GB GPU\n1x A100-80GB GPU\nPreferred/Supported] Operating System(s): Linux\nTraining Datasets\nA large variety of training data was used for the post-training pipeline, including manually annotated data and synthetic data.\nThe data for the multi-stage post-training phases for improvements in Code, Math, and Reasoning is a compilation of SFT and RL data that supports improvements of math, code, general reasoning, and instruction following capabilities of the original Llama instruct model.\nPrompts have been sourced from either public and open corpus or synthetically generated. Responses were synthetically generated by a variety of models, with some prompts containing responses for both Reasoning On and Off modes, to train the model to distinguish between two modes.\nData Collection for Training Datasets:\nHybrid: Automated, Human, Synthetic\nData Labeling for Training Datasets:\nN/A\nEvaluation Datasets\nWe used the datasets listed below to evaluate Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1.\nData Collection for Evaluation Datasets: Hybrid: Human/Synthetic\nData Labeling for Evaluation Datasets: Hybrid: Human/Synthetic/Automatic\nEvaluation Results\nThese results contain both “Reasoning On”, and “Reasoning Off”.

Devstral excels at using tools to explore codebases, editing multiple files and power software engineering agents. The model achieves remarkable performance on SWE-bench which positionates it as the #1 open source model on this benchmark.\nIt is finetuned from Mistral-Small-3.1, therefore it has a long context window of up to 128k tokens. As a coding agent, Devstral is text-only and before fine-tuning from Mistral-Small-3.1 the vision encoder was removed.\nFor enterprises requiring specialized capabilities (increased context, domain-specific knowledge, etc.), we will release commercial models beyond what Mistral AI contributes to the community.\nLearn more about Devstral in our blog post.\nKey Features:\nAgentic coding: Devstral is designed to excel at agentic coding tasks, making it a great choice for software engineering agents.\nlightweight: with its compact size of just 24 billion parameters, Devstral is light enough to run on a single RTX 4090 or a Mac with 32GB RAM, making it an appropriate model for local deployment and on-device use.\nApache 2.0 License: Open license allowing usage and modification for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.\nContext Window: A 128k context window.\nTokenizer: Utilizes a Tekken tokenizer with a 131k vocabulary size.\nBenchmark Results\nSWE-Bench\nDevstral achieves a score of 46.8% on SWE-Bench Verified, outperforming prior open-source SoTA by 6%.\nModel\nScaffold\nSWE-Bench Verified (%)\nDevstral\nOpenHands Scaffold\n46.8\nGPT-4.1-mini\nOpenAI Scaffold\n23.6\nClaude 3.5 Haiku\nAnthropic Scaffold\n40.6\nSWE-smith-LM 32B\nSWE-agent Scaffold\n40.2\nWhen evaluated under the same test scaffold (OpenHands, provided by All Hands AI 🙌), Devstral exceeds far larger models such as Deepseek-V3-0324 and Qwen3 232B-A22B.\nUsage\nWe recommend to use Devstral with the OpenHands scaffold.\nYou can use it either through our API or by running locally.\nAPI\nFollow these instructions to create a Mistral account and get an API key.\nThen run these commands to start the OpenHands docker container.\nexport MISTRAL_API_KEY=<MY_KEY>\ndocker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.39-nikolaik\nmkdir -p ~/.openhands-state && echo '{\"language\":\"en\",\"agent\":\"CodeActAgent\",\"max_iterations\":null,\"security_analyzer\":null,\"confirmation_mode\":false,\"llm_model\":\"mistral/devstral-small-2505\",\"llm_api_key\":\"'$MISTRAL_API_KEY'\",\"remote_runtime_resource_factor\":null,\"github_token\":null,\"enable_default_condenser\":true}' > ~/.openhands-state/settings.json\ndocker run -it --rm --pull=always \\\n-e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.39-nikolaik \\\n-e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \\\n-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n-v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \\\n-p 3000:3000 \\\n--add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \\\n--name openhands-app \\\ndocker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.39\nLocal inference\nThe model can also be deployed with the following libraries:\nvllm (recommended): See here\nmistral-inference: See here\ntransformers: See here\nLMStudio: See here\nllama.cpp: See here\nollama: See here\nOpenHands (recommended)\nLaunch a server to deploy Devstral Small 1.0\nMake sure you launched an OpenAI-compatible server such as vLLM or Ollama as described above. Then, you can use OpenHands to interact with Devstral Small 1.0.\nIn the case of the tutorial we spineed up a vLLM server running the command:\nvllm serve mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505 --tokenizer_mode mistral --config_format mistral --load_format mistral --tool-call-parser mistral --enable-auto-tool-choice --tensor-parallel-size 2\nThe server address should be in the following format: http://<your-server-url>:8000/v1\nLaunch OpenHands\nYou can follow installation of OpenHands here.\nThe easiest way to launch OpenHands is to use the Docker image:\ndocker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.38-nikolaik\ndocker run -it --rm --pull=always \\\n-e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.38-nikolaik \\\n-e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \\\n-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n-v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \\\n-p 3000:3000 \\\n--add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \\\n--name openhands-app \\\ndocker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.38\nThen, you can access the OpenHands UI at http://localhost:3000.\nConnect to the server\nWhen accessing the OpenHands UI, you will be prompted to connect to a server.

Let's build a To-Do list app.\nTo-Do list app\nLet's ask Devstral to generate the app with the following prompt:\nBuild a To-Do list app with the following requirements:\n- Built using FastAPI and React.\n- Make it a one page app that:\n- Allows to add a task.\n- Allows to delete a task.\n- Allows to mark a task as done.\n- Displays the list of tasks.\n- Store the tasks in a SQLite database.\nLet's see the result\nYou should see the agent construct the app and be able to explore the code it generated.\nIf it doesn't do it automatically, ask Devstral to deploy the app or do it manually, and then go the front URL deployment to see the app.\nIterate\nNow that you have a first result you can iterate on it by asking your agent to improve it. For example, in the app generated we could click on a task to mark it checked but having a checkbox would improve UX. You could also ask it to add a feature to edit a task, or to add a feature to filter the tasks by status.\nEnjoy building with Devstral Small and OpenHands!\nvLLM (recommended)\nWe recommend using this model with the vLLM library\nto implement production-ready inference pipelines.\nInstallation\nMake sure you install vLLM >= 0.8.5:\npip install vllm --upgrade\nDoing so should automatically install mistral_common >= 1.5.5.\nTo check:\npython -c \"import mistral_common; print(mistral_common.__version__)\"\nYou can also make use of a ready-to-go docker image or on the docker hub.\nServer\nWe recommand that you use Devstral in a server/client setting.\nSpin up a server:\nvllm serve mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505 --tokenizer_mode mistral --config_format mistral --load_format mistral --tool-call-parser mistral --enable-auto-tool-choice --tensor-parallel-size 2\nTo ping the client you can use a simple Python snippet.\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nurl = \"http://<your-server-url>:8000/v1/chat/completions\"\nheaders = {\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", \"Authorization\": \"Bearer token\"}\nmodel = \"mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505\"\ndef load_system_prompt(repo_id: str, filename: str) -> str:\nfile_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id=repo_id, filename=filename)\nwith open(file_path, \"r\") as file:\nsystem_prompt = file.read()\nreturn system_prompt\nSYSTEM_PROMPT = load_system_prompt(model, \"SYSTEM_PROMPT.txt\")\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": SYSTEM_PROMPT},\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"text\",\n\"text\": \"<your-command>\",\n},\n],\n},\n]\ndata = {\"model\": model, \"messages\": messages, \"temperature\": 0.15}\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))\nprint(response.json()[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"])\nMistral-inference\nWe recommend using mistral-inference to quickly try out / \"vibe-check\" Devstral.\nInstall\nMake sure to have mistral_inference >= 1.6.0 installed.\npip install mistral_inference --upgrade\nDownload\nfrom huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\nfrom pathlib import Path\nmistral_models_path = Path.home().joinpath('mistral_models', 'Devstral')\nmistral_models_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\nsnapshot_download(repo_id=\"mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505\", allow_patterns=[\"params.json\", \"consolidated.safetensors\", \"tekken.json\"], local_dir=mistral_models_path)\nPython\nYou can run the model using the following command:\nmistral-chat $HOME/mistral_models/Devstral --instruct --max_tokens 300\nYou can then prompt it with anything you'd like.\nTransformers\nTo make the best use of our model with transformers make sure to have installed     mistral-common >= 1.5.5 to use our tokenizer.\npip install mistral-common --upgrade\nThen load our tokenizer along with the model and generate:\nimport torch\nfrom mistral_common.protocol.instruct.messages import (\nSystemMessage, UserMessage\n)\nfrom mistral_common.protocol.instruct.request import ChatCompletionRequest\nfrom mistral_common.tokens.tokenizers.mistral import MistralTokenizer\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM\ndef load_system_prompt(repo_id: str, filename: str) -> str:\nfile_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id=repo_id, filename=filename)\nwith open(file_path, \"r\") as file:\nsystem_prompt = file.read()\nreturn system_prompt\nmodel_id = \"mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505\"\ntekken_file = hf_hub_download(repo_id=model_id, filename=\"tekken.json\")\nSYSTEM_PROMPT = load_system_prompt(model_id, \"SYSTEM_PROMPT.txt\")\ntokenizer = MistralTokenizer.from_file(tekken_file)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)\ntokenized = tokenizer.encode_chat_completion(\nChatCompletionRequest(\nmessages=[\nSystemMessage(content=SYSTEM_PROMPT),\nUserMessage(content=\"<your-command>\"),\n],\n)\n)\noutput = model.generate(\ninput_ids=torch.tensor([tokenized.tokens]),\nmax_new_tokens=1000,\n)[0]\ndecoded_output = tokenizer.decode(output[len(tokenized.tokens):])\nprint(decoded_output)\nLMStudio\nDownload the weights from huggingface:\npip install -U \"huggingface_hub[cli]\"\nhuggingface-cli download \\\n\"mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505_gguf\" \\\n--include \"devstralQ4_K_M.gguf\" \\\n--local-dir \"mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505_gguf/\"\nYou can serve the model locally with LMStudio.\nDownload LM Studio and install it\nInstall lms cli ~/.lmstudio/bin/lms bootstrap\nIn a bash terminal, run lms import devstralQ4_K_M.gguf in the directory where you've downloaded the model checkpoint (e.g. mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505_gguf)\nOpen the LMStudio application, click the terminal icon to get into the developer tab.

It shows superior precision compared to both WebRTC VAD and Silero VAD, which are commonly used in the industry. Additionally, TEN VAD offers lower computational complexity and reduced memory usage compared to Silero VAD. Meanwhile, the architecture's temporal efficiency enables rapid voice activity detection, significantly reducing end-to-end response and turn detection latency in conversational AI systems.\nKey Features\n1. High-Performance:\nThe precision-recall curves comparing the performance of WebRTC VAD (pitch-based), Silero VAD, and TEN VAD are shown below. The evaluation is conducted on the precisely manually annotated testset. The audio files are from librispeech, gigaspeech, DNS Challenge etc. As demonstrated, TEN VAD achieves the best performance. Additionally, cross-validation experiments conducted on large internal real-world datasets demonstrate the reproducibility of these findings. The testset with annotated labels is released in directory \"testset\" of this repository.\nNote that the default threshold of 0.5 is used to generate binary speech indicators (0 for non-speech signal, 1 for speech signal). This threshold needs to be tuned according to your domain-specific task. The precision-recall curve can be obtained by executing the following script on Linux x64. The output figure will be saved in the same directory as the script.\ncd ./examples\npython plot_pr_curves.py\n2. Agent-Friendly:\nAs illustrated in the figure below, TEN VAD rapidly detects speech-to-non-speech transitions, whereas Silero VAD suffers from a delay of several hundred milliseconds, resulting in increased end-to-end latency in human-agent interaction systems. In addition, as demonstrated in the 6.5s-7.0s audio segment, Silero VAD fails to identify short silent durations between adjacent speech segments.\n3. Lightweight:\nWe evaluated the RTF (Real-Time Factor) across five distinct platforms, each equipped with varying CPUs. TEN VAD demonstrates much lower computational complexity and smaller library size than Silero VAD.\nPlatform\nCPU\nRTF\nLib Size\nTEN VAD\nSilero VAD\nTEN VAD\nSilero VAD\nLinux\nAMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12-Core\n0.0150\n/\n306KB\n2.16MB(JIT) / 2.22MB(ONNX)\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8253\n0.0136\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6348 CPU @ 2.60GHz\n0.0086\n0.0127\nWindows\nIntel i7-10710U\n0.0150\n/\n464KB(x86) / 508KB(x64)\nmacOS\nM1\n0.0160\n731KB\nAndroid\nGalaxy J6+ (32bit, 425)\n0.0570\n373KB(v7a) / 532KB(v8a)\nOppo A3s (450)\n0.0490\niOS\niPhone6 (A8)\n0.0210\n320KB\niPhone8 (A11)\n0.0050\n4. Multiple programming languages and platforms:\nTEN VAD provides cross-platform C compatibility across five operating systems (Linux x64, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS), with Python bindings optimized for Linux x64, with wasm for Web.\n5. Supproted sampling rate and hop size:\nTEN VAD operates on 16kHz audio input with configurable hop sizes (optimized frame configurations: 160/256 samples=10/16ms). Other sampling rates must be resampled to 16kHz.\nInstallation\ngit clone https://huggingface.co/TEN-framework/ten-vad\nQuick Start\nThe project supports five major platforms with dynamic library linking.\nPlatform\nDynamic Lib\nSupported Arch\nInterface Language\nHeader\nComment\nLinux\nlibten_vad.so\nx64\nPython, C\nten_vad.h  ten_vad.py\nWindows\nten_vad.dll\nx64, x86\nC\nmacOS\nten_vad.framework\narm64, x86_64\nC\nAndroid\nlibten_vad.so\narm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a\nC\niOS\nten_vad.framework\narm64\nC\n1. not simulator  2. not iPad\nPython Usage\n1.

However, recent\nadvancements are paving the way for Tabular Foundation Models, which can\nleverage real-world knowledge and generalize across diverse datasets,\nparticularly when the data contains free-text. Although incorporating language\nmodel capabilities into tabular tasks has been explored, most existing methods\nutilize static, target-agnostic textual representations, limiting their\neffectiveness. We introduce TabSTAR: a Foundation Tabular Model with\nSemantically Target-Aware Representations.

Model outputs plain-text characters, in a step-by-step, dialogue format.\nCharGen v3 series of models is a significant improvement over CharGen v2. It demonstrates exceptional instruction following and format adherence.\nCharGen is a project that started in 2023 with a goal to make character making effortless.\nWarning: this model was trained on some NSFW content, so it may produce NSFW characters.\nQuantized versions\nGGUF\nPrompting\nTo make a character, prompt the model using the following prompt ordering:\nSystem message\nDescription Prompt message or Facts Prompt\nIf Facts Prompt is used, follow up by Alternate Description Prompt\nAny of the other field prompts, in any order\nDialogue Example Prompt should be prompted last\nSupported fields and prompts:\nSystem Message\nYou are an expert in creating interesting roleplay characters. Your main goal is to create a vibrant persona for roleplay. Use on-point simple language, avoiding overly complex phrases. It is acceptable to assume or even create missing details about the character. Refer to roleplaying user as User.\nDescription Prompt\nThis is the very first thing you should query the model with.\nBase version (when Facts field is not in use):\nBelow is a brief overview of a character. Expand it into a detailed description. Include details about character's personality, their outfit and figure. Mention their age and gender, if applicable.\n---\n{{character_description}}\n---\nUse third person narration. Start your response with \"{{char_name}} is ...\"\nAlternate version (when used with conjunction with Facts field - it should follow Facts Prompt):\nExpand the brief character overview into a detailed description, taking these facts into account. Include details about character's personality, their outfit and figure. Mention their age and gender, if applicable. Use third person narration. Start your response with \"{{char_name}} is ...\"\nFacts Prompt\nFacts are small bits of interesting information about the character.\nAvoid using obvious facts like gender or age here - instead, add something peculiar; maybe your character owns a pet rock?\nFacts field is not part of Tavern Character Card V2 spec. Instead, they help the model to understand your character better and capture some of the more specific details.\nIdeal size for each fact is a single short sentence. Try to keep the total number of facts in 5-10 range.\nN.B.: When Facts field is in use, use Facts Prompt INSTEAD OF Description Prompt and use alternate version of Description prompt after Facts Prompt.\nBelow is a brief overview of a character. Enrich it by creating a list of interesting and peculiar facts about this character.\n---\n{{character_description}}\n---\nAvoid using obvious facts and things like gender or age. Write 5-10 facts in simple and concise language. Format your response as unordered list.\nScenario Prompt\nWrite an interesting and engaging scenario for roleplay between {{char_name}} and User.\nPersonality Prompt\nWrite several personal qualities that characterize {{char_name}}.\nAppearance Prompt\nThis field is not part of Tavern Character Card V2 spec, but it is useful for generating images for the character using Image Generation models.\nImagine what {{char_name}} could look like and describe {{char_name}}'s portrait. Capture their appearance, clothes and body features, as well as the background setting they can be in. Only include details that would be useful when describing their photo. Omit explanation or any personality traits that cannot be reflected graphically, and focus on visual characteristics instead. Your task is to give specific instructions on how to draw {{char_name}}'s portrait.\nFirst Message Prompt\nWrite the initial message in this roleplay that would introduce User to {{char_name}} and the scenario.\nDialogue Examples Prompt\nWrite a few example exchanges between User and {{char_name}} in chat format. Separate each exchange with a <START> tag.\nAlternate version for Dialogue Example Hints feature:\nWrite several chat exchanges between User and {{char_name}}. Each exchange should start with <START> tag, include a brief contextual summary in parentheses and show the dialogue between User and {{char_name}}, prefixed by names, each turn on new line.\nDialogue Example Hints\nThis model supports experimental feature called Dialogue Example Hints that allows you to specify the theme or even events for a particular dialogue example.\nHere is how it looks like from the prompting perspective:\n<|im_start|>user\nWrite several chat exchanges between User and {{char_name}}. Each exchange should start with <START> tag, include a brief contextual summary in parentheses and show the dialogue between User and {{char_name}}, prefixed by names, each turn on new line.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<START> ({{hint}})\n*newline here*\nThe partial assistant turn should be sent without the EOS token so model proceeds to generate a continuation of this same turn. In sampling settings, add string <START> to the list of stop words, so the model only generates a single dialogue example.\nTraining and Data\nWe stopped looking for diamonds in the rough – we now grow diamonds from coal.\nData for CharGen v3 series of models was gathered from publicly-available character card repositories and underwent a diligent manual vetting, proof-reading and partial re-writing of every single card. Process is long and tedious, and would not be possible without @Delta-Vector's help and support.\nCharGen v3's data pipeline is an improvement on v2 in several key aspects. Where v2 was mainly focused on finding the perfect cards in the raw corpus, v3 treats most cards as raw material for later enrichment steps.\nBy a rough estimate, @Delta-Vector and @kubernetes-bad spent ~400 hours (weekends included) on cards re-writing. This number does not include the initial manual vetting of cards.\nWith v3, the key was to stop treating \"bad\" cards as binary rejects. Now, a card would need to pass just a small list of rule-based pre-filters (is card plaintext? Is it english? How's the length? etc.) to be considered for the next steps, where it would undergo iterative manual improvements.\nTools\nGrammar correcting T5-based model cascade from v2 was replaced with a more sophisticated ensemble of large language models that would attempt to fix both grammar and logical/stylistic inconsistencies. Traditional grammar checkers would sometimes also \"fix\" author's deliberate stylistic choices, just because they're trained on correctness and not so much on conversational language understanding. The solution was to combine three approaches:\nSemantic Richness Scoring\nA custom tool, Concepts, analyzed character card in embedding space for features like mentions of character relation to User, personality traits and aspects, or character's hobbies, likes and dislikes. This wasn't so much about judging character card quality, but estimating the amount of human work a card would need to be considered good. Output of each of those Concepts was then summed up to represent a proxy for \"character richness\" metric. The intuition is that if a character has all those things mentioned - chances are good that it will have many more things that make a character good, even if there wasn't a Concept for that feature specifically. Higher score = better.\nLLM-Assisted Refinement\nMistral-Large and Claude 3.5 Haiku were both tasked with correcting grammar and fixing logical consistency where necessary. Modern language models are great at preserving author's voice: where T5 would rewrite a brooding vampire's accented dialogue into just... normal text, these models kept the atmosphere while fixing stuff like pronoun mismatches (as well as grammar, of course). A custom tool, Fuckery, was used to let human annotators to verify every AI edit suggestion and quickly cherry-pick the ones that they agree with or edit it in-place, using a git-merge style web interface.\nHuman Touch\nSame tool was employed for the final step - manual rewriting. Some cards were mostly fine, but had some problems like delving too deep into unrelated details about character's extended family, or incorporating jailbreak-like instructions right in the card, or just needed some tweaks and paragraph re-arrangement, so the were manually reviewed and edited. It's vital to mention: the preservation of the original card's author vision was absolutely key in this step. If there was even a hint of discrepancy between factual correctness and author's vision - the priority would always go for author's vision, even if that would contradict common sense. Sometimes, this could also indicate a bad quality card, but in rare occasions it was actually part of the vibe that author was going for.\nHuman Data Augmentation\nEarly on into the project, a non-negotiable rule was established: human editors should edit grammar and style, not intent. When encountering cards with disturbing or morally questionable content, editors were instructed to either:\nCorrect syntax/formatting without altering meaning (e.g., fixing a serial killer’s rambling manifesto into coherent sentences), or\nSkip the card entirely if unable to separate technical from ethical judgement\nThis highlights the tool-like nature of CharGen series of models. The model should be able to generate a wide range of characters, without moralizing or any judgment whatsoever. It's the end user's privilege to decide what is acceptable and what is not. If a character's \"core idea\" was controversial or even disturbing, but well-executed, it was improved for clarity and consistency - but not fundamentally changed. It is partly for this reason - inclusion of potentially disturbing content curated for data diversity - that the dataset itself is not planned for public release.\nReinforcement Learning\nCharGen v3-mini is trained as a milestone model to hone the reinforcement learning formula that would be then applied to bigger models. Its smaller size (4b parameters vs 24b for full v3 model) allowed for faster iteration and made experimentation cheaper. More novel and potentially risky things could be tried with v3-mini without making the author noticeably poorer.\nGRPO for creative writing\nFor reinforcement learning, GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method was chosen - in contrast to v2's offline DPO (Direct Policy Optimization). GRPO is an online training method, meaning that it alters the model \"live\" - as it generates samples, its weights are altered based on the results of those outputs.\nCommonly, PPO is used for this type of training by big labs, but it's hard to pull off since it requires careful tuning of many, many moving parts and VRAM requirements are enormous. GRPO simplifies online reinforcement learning by eliminating the need for a separate advantage estimation model - instead, it generates several candidate outputs for a given prompt, then applies a reward function to each, and then calculates the relative advantage for the group of samples. This, plus its sample-level loss (vs token-level in classic PPO), makes the training more stable.\nOriginal GRPO paper focused mostly on verifiable rewards – where an output's correctness can be objectively proven, like checking math solutions or executing code. Applying it to a very subjective domain like creative writing, where \"correctness\" is hard or straight up impossible to quantify, was CharGen's experimental adaptation of GRPO technique.\nDataset for GRPO is derived from user-submitted preference data from CharGen App - over the course of last year, users generated countless characters and some submitted feedback in the form of simple thumbs-up/thumbs-down signal. These prompts were used in making the reinforcement learning dataset for prompting CharGen model in online learning setting (original generations from these feedback submissions weren't used).\nReward Orchestration\nDefining what makes a character \"good\" is hard and very context-dependent. A reward signal needs to be more sophisticated than any single metric that's applied all the time. To handle that, a custom reward orchestration framework, reward-composer, was developed. It works with both Axolotl and TRL trainers, and allows for describing complex relationships between the individual reward functions.\nreward-composer makes it relatively easy to specify dependencies (e.g., reward B only applies if conditions of qualifier A is met) and conditions, composing these smaller reward signals into one complex and dynamic reward function.\nThis is important because CharGen v3 models generate characters step-by-step in a dialogue format, where the quality criteria for one field (like 'Personality') might differ significantly from another (like 'Example Dialogues') and depend heavily on previously generated fields.\nReward Signals\nThe set of active reward functions dynamically changed depending on the current step in the character generation flow. But overarching goal remained consistent: guide the model towards outputs that represent a well-formed, coherent character aligned with the user's prompt (and what we know a good character should look like).\nOne of the main components of CharGen's reward design was an ensemble of LLM judges. This means that several independent models would grade CharGen's outputs based on the same rubric and then produce a composite score. This score represented how well the model's response for a specific field adhered to the initial user prompt and the dialogue history (previously generated character fields). Basically, it measured prompt adherence and character consistency.\nTo make the model stay on course and keep it format-consistent (LLM judges don't necessarily know what makes a markdown dialogue good), auxiliary rewards were used.These included penalties for incoherence, over-long generation, or breaking the expected dialogue format.\nConcepts library was used here too, boosting scores of generations that included desirable features like relationship to User, looks and age - but only slightly, in order to prevent model from gaming the system and looksmaxxing the entire response, for example.\nFighting Slop\nCharGen v3's RL had a critical auxiliary reward specifically targeted at reducing the use of common AI cliché phrases, also known as \"slop\". Phrases like \"can't help but...\", \"a mixture of X and Y\", \"kiss-bruised lips\" or \"half-lidded eyes\" are often overused by models in context of role play. Slop is a nasty defect that easily breaks immersion in a roleplay session. Presence of slop in a character card \"primes\" the RP session towards generating more of the slop, turning the whole session into one slop-fest.\nTo combat slop, CharGen v3's RL step includes targeted slop-penalty reward function. The process involved:\nGenerating a large set of character fields using the pre-RL CharGen v3-mini model with prompts from the RL training dataset.\nBuilding an n-gram frequency table from these generated outputs.\nManually curating this frequency table, removing common English phrase ngrams (I do n't want to, is a very, etc.) to isolate the specific, repetitive clichés favored by this model in this domain.\nUsing this curated slop-list into a reward as a penalty signal – the frequency of the slop phrases used would be summed up and normalized for completion length, and then used as a penalty. Essentially - it's not just \"used bad word = get 0 reward\", but rather \"how bad of a bad word was used\". Resulting reward signal is then scaled with a sigmoid function (turns out, pre-RL CharGen was not super-duper sloppy to begin with).\nThis reward pushes model to more original and varied wording without penalizing common English phrases, or slop that model wouldn't use anyway. Eliminating slop was a key objective for improving the natural feel and usefulness of characters made with CharGen v3 models.\nTraining Scale\nOver total of 44 RL runs (SFT runs counted separately), for CharGen v3-mini, ~200,000 LLM judge requests were made. Judge models used were DeepSeek R1, Llama3.1 405b Instruct and DeepSeek v3-0324.\nWith applying GRPO to not-so-verifiable rewards, CharGen v3-mini demonstrates improvements in complex instruction following and makes it able to maintain character consistency throughout the whole character generation dialogue.\nLicensing and Attribution\nThis model is a derivative work based on Delta-Vector/Holland-4B-V1, licensed under MIT License.

To fill this gap, we propose VideoRFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. VideoRFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT datasets. We address this by building a fully automatic CoT curation pipeline. First, we devise a cognitioninspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a visual-language model conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two new datasets VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To further strength the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning with visual evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that VideoRFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning benchmarks.\n✨ Methodology\nTo overcome the scarcity of video CoTs, we develop a scalable, cognitively inspired pipeline for high-quality video CoT dataset construction.\nTo further strength the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning with visual evidence.\n📀 Datasets\nBased on above pipeline, we construct two large-scale datasets, i.e., 📀VideoRFT-CoT-102K and 📀VideoRFT-RL-310K.\n🛠️ Set up\nRequirements\nPython >= 3.11\nPytorch >= 2.5.1\ntransformers == 4.51.3\nvLLM == 0.7.3\ntrl == 0.16.0\nInstallation\ngit clone https://github.com/QiWang98/VideoRFT\ncd VideoRFT\n# Create and activate environment\nconda create -n VideoRFT python=3.11\nconda activate VideoRFT\nbash setup.sh\n# Install decord for improved video processing\ncd src/qwen-vl-utils\npip install -e .[decord]\n🚀 Training\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\nWe begin with supervised fine-tuning on the VideoRFT-CoT dataset for one epoch:\nbash ./src/scripts/run_sft_video.sh\nThis step can be skipped by directly using our pretrained SFT models, available at 🤗VideoRFT-SFT-7B or 🤗VideoRFT-SFT-3B.\nReinforcement Learning (RL)\nNext, perform reinforcement learning using the VideoRFT-RL dataset:\nbash ./src/scripts/run_grpo_video.sh\nTo enable faster training via vLLM acceleration:\nbash ./src/scripts/run_grpo_vllm_qwen25vl.sh\nNote: During training, we adopt the following settings for efficiency:\nVIDEO PIXELS: 128 × 28 × 28\nFPS FRAMES: 16\nAll frame-related configurations can be adjusted in src/qwen-vl-utils.\n📈 Inference & Evaluation\nDuring inference, we increase the maximum frame resolution and length to boost performance:\nVIDEO PIXELS: 256 × 28 × 28\nFPS FRAMES: 32\nYou can configure these parameters in src/qwen-vl-utils.\nWe evaluate all models under a unified decoding configuration following the official Qwen2.5-VL demo:\ntop_p = 0.001\ntemperature = 0.01\nEvaluation Procedure\nDownload preprocessed evaluation JSONs from: [🤗 eval]\nDownload the video data from the official sites of each benchmark and organize them as specified in the JSON files.\nRun the evaluation across all benchmarks:\nbash ./src/eval_bench.sh\n🚀 Quick Inference Code\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nfrom longvu.builder import load_pretrained_model\nfrom longvu.constants import (\nDEFAULT_IMAGE_TOKEN,\nIMAGE_TOKEN_INDEX,\n)\nfrom longvu.conversation import conv_templates, SeparatorStyle\nfrom longvu.mm_datautils import (\nKeywordsStoppingCriteria,\nprocess_images,\ntokenizer_image_token,\n)\nfrom decord import cpu, VideoReader\ntokenizer, model, image_processor, context_len = load_pretrained_model(\n\"./checkpoints/longvu_qwen\", None, \"cambrian_qwen\",\n)\nmodel.eval()\nvideo_path = \"./examples/video1.mp4\"\nqs = \"Describe this video in detail\"\nvr = VideoReader(video_path, ctx=cpu(0), num_threads=1)\nfps = float(vr.get_avg_fps())\nframe_indices = np.array([i for i in range(0, len(vr), round(fps),)])\nvideo = []\nfor frame_index in frame_indices:\nimg = vr[frame_index].asnumpy()\nvideo.append(img)\nvideo = np.stack(video)\nimage_sizes = [video[0].shape[:2]]\nvideo = process_images(video, image_processor, model.config)\nvideo = [item.unsqueeze(0) for item in video]\nqs = DEFAULT_IMAGE_TOKEN + \"\n\" + qs\nconv = conv_templates[\"qwen\"].copy()\nconv.append_message(conv.roles[0], qs)\nconv.append_message(conv.roles[1], None)\nprompt = conv.get_prompt()\ninput_ids = tokenizer_image_token(prompt, tokenizer, IMAGE_TOKEN_INDEX, return_tensors=\"pt\").unsqueeze(0).to(model.device)\nstop_str = conv.sep if conv.sep_style != SeparatorStyle.TWO else conv.sep2\nkeywords = [stop_str]\nstopping_criteria = KeywordsStoppingCriteria(keywords, tokenizer, input_ids)\nwith torch.inference_mode():\noutput_ids = model.generate(\ninput_ids,\nimages=video,\nimage_sizes=image_sizes,\ndo_sample=False,\ntemperature=0.2,\nmax_new_tokens=128,\nuse_cache=True,\nstopping_criteria=[stopping_criteria],\n)\npred = tokenizer.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0].strip()\n🙏 Acknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge the contributions of the open-source community, particularly DeepSeek-R1, Open-R1, and R1-V.\n📚 Citations\nIf you find this work helpful, please consider citing:\n@article{VideoRFT,\ntitle={VideoRFT: Incentivizing Video Reasoning Capability in MLLMs via Reinforced Fine-Tuning},\nauthor={Wang, Qi and Yu, Yanrui and Yuan, Ye and Mao, Rui and Zhou, Tianfei},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2505.12434},\nyear={2025}\n}",

Developers can use MedGemma to accelerate building\nhealthcare-based AI applications. MedGemma currently comes in three variants: a\n4B multimodal version and 27B text-only and multimodal versions.\nBoth MedGemma multimodal versions utilize a\nSigLIP image encoder that has been\nspecifically pre-trained on a variety of de-identified medical data, including\nchest X-rays, dermatology images, ophthalmology images, and histopathology\nslides. Their LLM components are trained on a diverse set of medical data,\nincluding medical text, medical question-answer pairs, FHIR-based electronic\nhealth record data (27B multimodal only), radiology images, histopathology\npatches, ophthalmology images, and dermatology images.\nMedGemma 4B is available in both pre-trained (suffix: -pt) and\ninstruction-tuned (suffix -it) versions. The instruction-tuned version is a\nbetter starting point for most applications. The pre-trained version is\navailable for those who want to experiment more deeply with the models.\nMedGemma 27B multimodal has pre-training on medical image, medical record and\nmedical record comprehension tasks. MedGemma 27B text-only has been trained\nexclusively on medical text. Both models have been optimized for inference-time\ncomputation on medical reasoning. This means it has slightly higher performance\non some text benchmarks than MedGemma 27B multimodal. Users who want to work\nwith a single model for both medical text, medical record and medical image\ntasks are better suited for MedGemma 27B multimodal. Those that only need text\nuse-cases may be better served with the text-only variant. Both MedGemma 27B\nvariants are only available in instruction-tuned versions.\nMedGemma variants have been evaluated on a range of clinically relevant\nbenchmarks to illustrate their baseline performance. These evaluations are based\non both open benchmark datasets and curated datasets. Developers can fine-tune\nMedGemma variants for improved performance. Consult the Intended\nUse\nsection below for more details.\nMedGemma is optimized for medical applications that involve a text generation\ncomponent. For medical image-based applications that do not involve text\ngeneration, such as data-efficient classification, zero-shot classification, or\ncontent-based or semantic image retrieval, the MedSigLIP image\nencoder\nis recommended. MedSigLIP is based on the same image encoder that powers\nMedGemma.\nPlease consult the MedGemma Technical Report\nfor more details.\nHow to use\nBelow are some example code snippets to help you quickly get started running the\nmodel locally on GPU.

MedGemma is intended for\ndevelopers in the life sciences and healthcare space. Developers are responsible\nfor training, adapting and making meaningful changes to MedGemma to accomplish\ntheir specific intended use. MedGemma models can be fine-tuned by developers\nusing their own proprietary data for their specific tasks or solutions.\nMedGemma is based on Gemma 3 and has been further trained on medical images and\ntext. MedGemma enables further development in any medical context (image and\ntextual), however the model was pre-trained using chest X-ray, pathology,\ndermatology, and fundus images. Examples of tasks within MedGemma's training\ninclude visual question answering pertaining to medical images, such as\nradiographs, or providing answers to textual medical questions. Full details of\nall the tasks MedGemma has been evaluated can be found in the MedGemma\nTechnical Report.\nBenefits\nProvides strong baseline medical image and text comprehension for models of\nits size.\nThis strong performance makes it efficient to adapt for downstream\nhealthcare-based use cases, compared to models of similar size without\nmedical data pre-training.\nThis adaptation may involve prompt engineering, grounding, agentic\norchestration or fine-tuning depending on the use case, baseline validation\nrequirements, and desired performance characteristics.\nLimitations\nMedGemma is not intended to be used without appropriate validation, adaptation\nand/or making meaningful modification by developers for their specific use case.\nThe outputs generated by MedGemma are not intended to directly inform clinical\ndiagnosis, patient management decisions, treatment recommendations, or any other\ndirect clinical practice applications. Performance benchmarks highlight baseline\ncapabilities on relevant benchmarks, but even for image and text domains that\nconstitute a substantial portion of training data, inaccurate model output is\npossible. All outputs from MedGemma should be considered preliminary and require\nindependent verification, clinical correlation, and further investigation\nthrough established research and development methodologies.\nMedGemma's multimodal capabilities have been primarily evaluated on single-image\ntasks. MedGemma has not been evaluated in use cases that involve comprehension\nof multiple images.\nMedGemma has not been evaluated or optimized for multi-turn applications.\nMedGemma's training may make it more sensitive to the specific prompt used than\nGemma 3.\nWhen adapting MedGemma developer should consider the following:\nBias in validation data: As with any research, developers should ensure\nthat any downstream application is validated to understand performance using\ndata that is appropriately representative of the intended use setting for\nthe specific application (e.g., age, sex, gender, condition, imaging device,\netc).\nData contamination concerns: When evaluating the generalization\ncapabilities of a large model like MedGemma in a medical context, there is a\nrisk of data contamination, where the model might have inadvertently seen\nrelated medical information during its pre-training, potentially\noverestimating its true ability to generalize to novel medical concepts.\nDevelopers should validate MedGemma on datasets not publicly available or\notherwise made available to non-institutional researchers to mitigate this\nrisk.\nRelease notes\nMay 20, 2025: Initial Release\nJuly 9, 2025 Bug Fix: Fixed the subtle degradation in the multimodal\nperformance. The issue was due to a missing end-of-image token in the model\nvocabulary, impacting combined text-and-image tasks. This fix reinstates and\ncorrectly maps that token, ensuring text-only tasks remain unaffected while\nrestoring multimodal performance.",

We achieve this with a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the two-dimensional (2D) renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video.\nThis model is ready for commercial/non-commercial use\nLicense/Terms of Use:\nThis model is released under the NVIDIA Open Model License.

Quickstart\n(ICML 2025 Poster) SAE-V: Interpreting Multimodal Models for Enhanced Alignment\nThis repository contains the SAE-V model for our ICML 2025 Poster paper \"SAE-V: Interpreting Multimodal Models for Enhanced Alignment\", including 2 sparse autoencoder (SAE) and 3 sparse autoencoder with Vision (SAE-V).

For the SAE and SAE-V parameters, we set different hook layers and context sizes based on the distinct architectures of the two models. We also experimented with different feature numbers on both models, but found that only around 30,000 features are actually activated during training. All training runs were conducted until convergence. All SAE and SAE-V training is performed on 8xA800 GPUs. We ensured that the variations in the parameters did not affect the experiment results.\n2. Quickstart\nThe SAE and SAE-V is developed based on SAELens-V. The loading example is as follow:\nfrom saev_lens import SAE\nsae = SAE.load_from_pretrained(\npath = \"./SAEV_LLaVA_NeXT-7b_OBELICS\",\ndevice =\"cuda:0\"\n)\nMore using tutorial is presented in SAELens-V.",

More detailed description on Civitai\nVpred version\nVpred version is now available.\nIt works flawlessly out of box without any burning or related issues. Consider to use lower CFG (3..5), other generation settings are same. Some exotic and experimental samplers/schedulers untested.\nKey advantages:\nFresh and wast knowledge about characters (1 2), concepts, styles(list examples), cultural and related things\nThe best prompt adherence among SDXL anime models at the moment of release\nSolved main problems with tags bleeding and biases, common for Illustrious, NoobAi and other checkpoints\nExcellent aesthetics and knowledge across a wide range of styles (over 50,000 artists, including hundreds of unique cherry-picked datasets from private galleries, including those received from the artists themselves)\nHigh flexibility and variety without stability tradeoff\nNo more annoying watermarks for popular styles thanks to clean dataset\nVibrant colors and smooth gradients without trace of burning, full range even with epsilon\nPure training from Illustrious v0.1 without involving third-party checkpoints, Loras, tweakers, etc.\nDataset cut-off - end if April 2025.\nFeatures and prompting:\nImportant change:\nWhen you are prompting artist styles, especially mixing several, their tags MUST BE in a separate CLIP chunk. Add BREAK after it (for A1111 and derivatives), use conditioning concat node (for Comfy) or at least put them in the very end. Otherwise, significant degradation of results is likely.\nThe model is designed to work both with short booru tag-based and long complex natural text prompts. The best result can be achieved using the combination of tags and some natural text phrases.\nFor tags classic danbooru-style comma-separated tags without underscores were used.\nBasic settings:\n~1..1.5 megapixel for txt2img, any AR with resolution multiple of 64 (1024x1024, 1152x, 1216x832,...). Euler_a, CFG 4..8 for epsilon/3..5 for vpred, 20..28steps. LCM/PCM/DMD untested, cfg++ samplers work fine, some shedulers not working. Highresfix: x1.5 latent + denoise 0.6 or any gan + denoise 0.3..0.55.\nPlease note that vpred version requires a lower CFG value.\nExamples can be found in repo, more on civitai.\nQuality tags:\nThere are only 4:\nmasterpiece, best quality\nfor positive and\nlow quality, worst quality\nfor negative\nNothing else. All except low quality in negative can be ommited.\nMeta tags like lowres have been removed, do not use them. Low resolution images have been either removed or upscaled and cleaned with DAT depending on their importance\nNegative prompt:\nworst quality, low quality, watermark\nFor best results keep it as clean as possible. Spamming of popular sequences will not improve results, since all related flaws have been solved, but will only lead to unwanted effects, biases and poor quality.\nArtist styles:\nThe model knows over 35k of artist styles. List, grids with example on Mega. Used with by , will not work properly without it.\nGeneral styles:\n2.5d, anime screencap, bold line, sketch, cgi, digital painting, flat colors, smooth shading, minimalistic, ink style, oil style, pastel style\nNatural text\nUse it in combination with booru tags, works great. Use only natural text after typing styles and quality tags. Use just booru tags and forget about it, it's all up to you. About 4M of pitures from dataset have hybrid natural-text captions made by Claude, GPT, Gemini and ToriiGate\nVersion 0.8 comes with advanced understanding of natural text prompts, providing state of the art performance among SDXL anime models.\nIt doesn't mean that you are obligated to use nl prompts, tags only - completely fine, especially because understanding of tags combinations is also improved.\nBrightness/colors/contrast:\nYou can use extra meta tags to control it:\nlow brightness, high brightness, low saturation, high saturation, low gamma, high gamma, sharp colors, soft colors, hdr, sdr\nVpred version:\nVpred version for RouWei-0.8 will come soon.\nBase model and Float version\nYou can use FP32 version for more accurate merging, or to get some benefits from using text encoders in fp32 mode with Comfy.\nEpsilon and vpred versions here have a brief aesthetic polishing after main training to improve small details and coherence. If you want to use RouWei in merges, extract or finetune it without bringing that last things - you can use BASE VERSION of RouWei: FP16 FP32\nDiscord server\njoin\nSafety:\nModel tends to generate NSFW images for corresponding prompts, consider to add extra filtering.

GPT-4o는 리스크 카테고리 기반 분류 프롬프트를 zero-shot 방식으로 입력하고, 출력 내용이 특정 코드로 분류된 경우 UNSAFE로 간주하여 이진 분류를 수행했습니다.\n그 결과 자체적으로 구축한 한국어 평가 데이터셋에서 Kanana Safeguard의 분류 성능이 타 벤치마크 모델 대비 가장 우수한 성능을 나타냈습니다.\nModel\nF1 Score\nPrecision\nRecall\nKanana Safeguard 8B\n0.946\n0.944\n0.948\nLlamaGuard3 8B\n0.540\n0.893\n0.387\nShieldGemma 9B\n0.477\n0.640\n0.380\nGPT-4o (zero-shot)\n0.763\n0.696\n0.843\n표 2. 리스크 분류 체계에 따른 내부 한국어 테스트셋 기준 응답 분류 성능 비교\n모든 모델은 동일한 평가 데이터셋과 분류 기준으로 평가되었으며, 정책 및 모델 구조 차이에 따른 영향을 최소화하고, 공정하고 신뢰도 높은 비교가 가능하도록 설계되었습니다.\n한계점\nKanana Safeguard는 다음과 같은 한계점이 있으며, 이는 향후 지속적으로 개선해나갈 예정입니다.\n1. 오탐지 가능성 존재\n본 모델은 100% 완벽한 분류를 보장하지 않습니다. 특히, 모델의 정책은 일반적인 사용사례에 기반하여 수립되었기 때문에 특정한 도메인에서는 잘못 분류될 수 있습니다.\n2. Context 인식 미지원\n본 모델은 이전 대화 이력을 기반으로 문맥을 유지하거나 대화를 이어가는 기능은 제공하지 않습니다.\n3. 제한된 리스크 카테고리\n본 모델은 정해진 리스크만을 탐지하므로 실사례의 모든 리스크를 탐지할 수는 없습니다. 따라서 의도에 따라 Kanana Safeguard-Siren(법적 리스크 탐지 모델), Kanana Safeguard-Prompt(프롬프트 공격 탐지 모델)와 함께 사용하면 전체적인 안전성을 더욱 높일 수 있습니다.\nCitation\n@misc{Kanana Safeguard,\ntitle = {Kanana Safeguard},\nurl = {https://tech.kakao.com/posts/705},\nauthor = {Kanana Safeguard Team},\nmonth = {May},\nyear = {2025}\n}\nContributors\nJeongHwan Lee, Deok Jeong, HyeYeon Cho, JiEun Choi",

We propose a novel position embedding, named TMRoPE (Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE), to synchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio.\nReal-Time Voice and Video Chat: Architecture designed for fully real-time interactions, supporting chunked input and immediate output.\nNatural and Robust Speech Generation: Surpassing many existing streaming and non-streaming alternatives, demonstrating superior robustness and naturalness in speech generation.\nStrong Performance Across Modalities: Exhibiting exceptional performance across all modalities when benchmarked against similarly sized single-modality models. Qwen2.5-Omni outperforms the similarly sized Qwen2-Audio in audio capabilities and achieves comparable performance to Qwen2.5-VL-7B.\nExcellent End-to-End Speech Instruction Following: Qwen2.5-Omni shows performance in end-to-end speech instruction following that rivals its effectiveness with text inputs, evidenced by benchmarks such as MMLU and GSM8K.\nModel Architecture\nPerformance\nWe conducted a comprehensive evaluation of Qwen2.5-Omni, which demonstrates strong performance across all modalities when compared to similarly sized single-modality models and closed-source models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2-Audio, and Gemini-1.5-pro. In tasks requiring the integration of multiple modalities, such as OmniBench, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, in single-modality tasks, it excels in areas including speech recognition (Common Voice), translation (CoVoST2), audio understanding (MMAU), image reasoning (MMMU, MMStar), video understanding (MVBench), and speech generation (Seed-tts-eval and subjective naturalness).\nMultimodality  -> Text\nDatasets\nModel\nPerformance\nOmniBenchSpeech | Sound Event | Music |

we provide simple examples to show how to use Qwen2.5-Omni with 🤗 Transformers. The codes of Qwen2.5-Omni has been in the latest Hugging face transformers and we advise you to build from source with command:\npip uninstall transformers\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers@v4.51.3-Qwen2.5-Omni-preview\npip install accelerate\nor you might encounter the following error:\nKeyError: 'qwen2_5_omni'\nWe offer a toolkit to help you handle various types of audio and visual input more conveniently, as if you were using an API. This includes base64, URLs, and interleaved audio, images and videos. You can install it using the following command and make sure your system has ffmpeg installed:\n# It's highly recommended to use `[decord]` feature for faster video loading.\npip install qwen-omni-utils[decord] -U\nIf you are not using Linux, you might not be able to install decord from PyPI. In that case, you can use pip install qwen-omni-utils -U which will fall back to using torchvision for video processing. However, you can still install decord from source to get decord used when loading video.\n🤗  Transformers Usage\nHere we show a code snippet to show you how to use the chat model with transformers and qwen_omni_utils:\nimport soundfile as sf\nfrom transformers import Qwen2_5OmniForConditionalGeneration, Qwen2_5OmniProcessor\nfrom qwen_omni_utils import process_mm_info\n# default: Load the model on the available device(s)\nmodel = Qwen2_5OmniForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B\", torch_dtype=\"auto\", device_map=\"auto\")\n# We recommend enabling flash_attention_2 for better acceleration and memory saving.\n# model = Qwen2_5OmniForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\n#     \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B\",\n#     torch_dtype=\"auto\",\n#     device_map=\"auto\",\n#     attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\",\n# )\nprocessor = Qwen2_5OmniProcessor.from_pretrained(\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B\")\nconversation = [\n{\n\"role\": \"system\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You are Qwen, a virtual human developed by the Qwen Team, Alibaba Group, capable of perceiving auditory and visual inputs, as well as generating text and speech.\"}\n],\n},\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"video\", \"video\": \"https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-Omni/draw.mp4\"},\n],\n},\n]\n# set use audio in video\nUSE_AUDIO_IN_VIDEO = True\n# Preparation for inference\ntext = processor.apply_chat_template(conversation, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)\naudios, images, videos = process_mm_info(conversation, use_audio_in_video=USE_AUDIO_IN_VIDEO)\ninputs = processor(text=text, audio=audios, images=images, videos=videos, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True, use_audio_in_video=USE_AUDIO_IN_VIDEO)\ninputs = inputs.to(model.device).to(model.dtype)\n# Inference: Generation of the output text and audio\ntext_ids, audio = model.generate(**inputs, use_audio_in_video=USE_AUDIO_IN_VIDEO)\ntext = processor.batch_decode(text_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)\nprint(text)\nsf.write(\n\"output.wav\",\naudio.reshape(-1).detach().cpu().numpy(),\nsamplerate=24000,\n)\nMinimum GPU memory requirements\nModel\nPrecision\n15(s) Video\n30(s) Video\n60(s) Video\nQwen-Omni-3B\nFP32\n89.10 GB\nNot Recommend\nNot Recommend\nQwen-Omni-3B\nBF16\n18.38 GB\n22.43 GB\n28.22 GB\nQwen-Omni-7B\nFP32\n93.56 GB\nNot Recommend\nNot Recommend\nQwen-Omni-7B\nBF16\n31.11 GB\n41.85 GB\n60.19 GB\nNote: The table above presents the theoretical minimum memory requirements for inference with transformers and BF16 is test with attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\"; however, in practice, the actual memory usage is typically at least 1.2 times higher. For more information, see the linked resource here.\nVideo URL resource usage\nVideo URL compatibility largely depends on the third-party library version. The details are in the table below. Change the backend by FORCE_QWENVL_VIDEO_READER=torchvision or FORCE_QWENVL_VIDEO_READER=decord if you prefer not to use the default one.\nBackend\nHTTP\nHTTPS\ntorchvision >= 0.19.0\n✅\n✅\ntorchvision < 0.19.0\n❌\n❌\ndecord\n✅\n❌\nBatch inference\nThe model can batch inputs composed of mixed samples of various types such as text, images, audio and videos as input when return_audio=False is set. Here is an example.\n# Sample messages for batch inference\n# Conversation with video only\nconversation1 = [\n{\n\"role\": \"system\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You are Qwen, a virtual human developed by the Qwen Team, Alibaba Group, capable of perceiving auditory and visual inputs, as well as generating text and speech.\"}\n],\n},\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"video\", \"video\": \"/path/to/video.mp4\"},\n]\n}\n]\n# Conversation with audio only\nconversation2 = [\n{\n\"role\": \"system\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You are Qwen, a virtual human developed by the Qwen Team, Alibaba Group, capable of perceiving auditory and visual inputs, as well as generating text and speech.\"}\n],\n},\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"audio\", \"audio\": \"/path/to/audio.wav\"},\n]\n}\n]\n# Conversation with pure text\nconversation3 = [\n{\n\"role\": \"system\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You are Qwen, a virtual human developed by the Qwen Team, Alibaba Group, capable of perceiving auditory and visual inputs, as well as generating text and speech.\"}\n],\n},\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": \"who are you?\"\n}\n]\n# Conversation with mixed media\nconversation4 = [\n{\n\"role\": \"system\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You are Qwen, a virtual human developed by the Qwen Team, Alibaba Group, capable of perceiving auditory and visual inputs, as well as generating text and speech.\"}\n],\n},\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"image\", \"image\": \"/path/to/image.jpg\"},\n{\"type\": \"video\", \"video\": \"/path/to/video.mp4\"},\n{\"type\": \"audio\", \"audio\": \"/path/to/audio.wav\"},\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What are the elements can you see and hear in these medias?\"},\n],\n}\n]\n# Combine messages for batch processing\nconversations = [conversation1, conversation2, conversation3, conversation4]\n# set use audio in video\nUSE_AUDIO_IN_VIDEO = True\n# Preparation for batch inference\ntext = processor.apply_chat_template(conversations, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)\naudios, images, videos = process_mm_info(conversations, use_audio_in_video=USE_AUDIO_IN_VIDEO)\ninputs = processor(text=text, audio=audios, images=images, videos=videos, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True, use_audio_in_video=USE_AUDIO_IN_VIDEO)\ninputs = inputs.to(model.device).to(model.dtype)\n# Batch Inference\ntext_ids = model.generate(**inputs, use_audio_in_video=USE_AUDIO_IN_VIDEO, return_audio=False)\ntext = processor.batch_decode(text_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)\nprint(text)\nUsage Tips\nPrompt for audio output\nIf users need audio output, the system prompt must be set as \"You are Qwen, a virtual human developed by the Qwen Team, Alibaba Group, capable of perceiving auditory and visual inputs, as well as generating text and speech.\", otherwise the audio output may not work as expected.\n{\n\"role\": \"system\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You are Qwen, a virtual human developed by the Qwen Team, Alibaba Group, capable of perceiving auditory and visual inputs, as well as generating text and speech.\"}\n],\n}\nUse audio in video\nIn the process of multimodal interaction, the videos provided by users are often accompanied by audio (such as questions about the content in the video, or sounds generated by certain events in the video). This information is conducive to the model providing a better interactive experience. So we provide the following options for users to decide whether to use audio in video.\n# first place, in data preprocessing\naudios, images, videos = process_mm_info(conversations, use_audio_in_video=True)\n# second place, in model processor\ninputs = processor(text=text, audio=audios, images=images, videos=videos, return_tensors=\"pt\",\npadding=True, use_audio_in_video=True)\n#  third place, in model inference\ntext_ids, audio = model.generate(**inputs, use_audio_in_video=True)\nIt is worth noting that during a multi-round conversation, the use_audio_in_video parameter in these places must be set to the same, otherwise unexpected results will occur.\nUse audio output or not\nThe model supports both text and audio outputs, if users do not need audio outputs, they can call model.disable_talker() after init the model. This option will save about ~2GB of GPU memory but the return_audio option for generate function will only allow to be set at False.\nmodel = Qwen2_5OmniForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\n\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B\",\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\nmodel.disable_talker()\nIn order to obtain a flexible experience, we recommend that users can decide whether to return audio when generate function is called. If return_audio is set to False, the model will only return text outputs to get text responses faster.\nmodel = Qwen2_5OmniForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\n\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B\",\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\n...\ntext_ids = model.generate(**inputs, return_audio=False)\nChange voice type of output audio\nQwen2.5-Omni supports the ability to change the voice of the output audio. The \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B\" checkpoint support two voice types as follow:\nVoice Type\nGender\nDescription\nChelsie\nFemale\nA honeyed, velvety voice that carries a gentle warmth and luminous clarity.\nEthan\nMale\nA bright, upbeat voice with infectious energy and a warm, approachable vibe.\nUsers can use the speaker parameter of generate function to specify the voice type. By default, if speaker is not specified, the default voice type is Chelsie.\ntext_ids, audio = model.generate(**inputs, speaker=\"Chelsie\")\ntext_ids, audio = model.generate(**inputs, speaker=\"Ethan\")\nFlash-Attention 2 to speed up generation\nFirst, make sure to install the latest version of Flash Attention 2:\npip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation\nAlso, you should have hardware that is compatible with FlashAttention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of the flash attention repository. FlashAttention-2 can only be used when a model is loaded in torch.float16 or torch.bfloat16.\nTo load and run a model using FlashAttention-2, add attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\" when loading the model:\nfrom transformers import Qwen2_5OmniForConditionalGeneration\nmodel = Qwen2_5OmniForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\n\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\nattn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\",\n)\nCitation\nIf you find our paper and code useful in your research, please consider giving a star :star: and citation :pencil: :)\n@article{Qwen2.5-Omni,\ntitle={Qwen2.5-Omni Technical Report},\nauthor={Jin Xu, Zhifang Guo, Jinzheng He, Hangrui Hu, Ting He, Shuai Bai, Keqin Chen, Jialin Wang, Yang Fan, Kai Dang, Bin Zhang, Xiong Wang, Yunfei Chu, Junyang Lin},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.20215},\nyear={2025}\n}",

We are continuously improving the Fanar’s models and capabilities, and answers can differ from what you get from Fanar-1-9B-Instruct.\nEthical Considerations & Limitations\nFanar-1-9B-Instruct is capable of generating fluent and contextually appropriate responses. However, as with any generative model there are uncertainities. The model may produce biased, offensive, or incorrect outputs. The model is not suitable for high-stakes decision-making (e.g., legal, medical, or financial advice). Though we have extensively tested Fanar-1-9B-Instruct and attempted to mitigate these issues, we cannot redress every possible scenario. Thus, we advise developers to implement safety checks and perform domain-specific fine-tuning for sensitive use cases.

Compared to its predecessor, RoboBrain 1.0, the new version is designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. RoboBrain 2.0 comes in three variants: an ultra-lightweight 3B model, a lightweight 7B model, and a full-scale 32B model, all featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model.\nDespite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 delivers exceptional performance across a wide range of embodied reasoning tasks. The newly released 3B model is optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, being extremely lightweight and easy to deploy, with spatial understanding capabilities comparable to the 7B model, making it ideal for edge devices and real-time applications. The 7B model strikes a balance between performance and computational requirements, suitable for diverse scenarios, while the 32B model achieves leading results in most spatial and temporal benchmarks, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. RoboBrain 2.0 supports critical real-world embodied intelligence capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and real-time scene memory).\nThis report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure, and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents.\n📆 Todo\nRelease model checkpoint for RoboBrain 2.0-3B\nRelease model checkpoint for RoboBrain 2.0-7B\nRelease quick inference example for RoboBrain 2.0\nRelease training codes for RoboBrain 2.0\nRelease model checkpoint for RoboBrain 2.0-32B\n🚀 Features\nRoboBrain 2.0 supports interactive reasoning with long-horizon planning and closed-loop feedback, spatial perception for precise point and bbox prediction from complex instructions, temporal perception for future trajectory estimation, and scene reasoning through real-time structured memory construction and update.\n⭐️ Architecture\nRoboBrain 2.0 supports multi-image, long video, and high-resolution visual inputs, along with complex task instructions and structured scene graphs on the language side. Visual inputs are processed via a Vision Encoder and MLP Projector, while textual inputs are tokenized into a unified token stream. All inputs are fed into a LLM Decoder that performs long-chain-of-thought reasoning and outputs structured plans, spatial relations, and both relative and absolute coordinates.\n🤗 Model Zoo\nModels\nCheckpoint\nDescription\nRoboBrain 2.0 3B\n🤗 BAAI/RoboBrain2.0-3B\n3B parameter version of the RoboBrain2.0\nRoboBrain 2.0 7B\n🤗 BAAI/RoboBrain2.0-7B\n7B parameter version of the RoboBrain2.0\nRoboBrain 2.0 32B\n🤗 BAAI/RoboBrain2.0-32B\n32B parameter version of the RoboBrain2.0\n🛠️ Setup\n# clone repo.\ngit clone https://github.com/FlagOpen/RoboBrain2.0.git\ncd RoboBrain\n# build conda env.\nconda create -n robobrain2 python=3.10\nconda activate robobrain2\npip install -r requirements.txt\n🤖 Simple Inference\nNote: Please refer to RoboBrain 2.0 Github for the usage of RoboBrain 2.0\n😊 More Results\nBenchmark comparison across spatial reasoning and temporal task planning.
