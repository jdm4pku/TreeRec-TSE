For more details of the models used and finetuning, please refer to the paper.\nWhat's new in V2?\nLarger and cleaner set of icon caption + grounding dataset\n60% improvement in latency compared to V1. Avg latency: 0.6s/frame on A100, 0.8s on single 4090.\nStrong performance: 39.6 average accuracy on ScreenSpot Pro\nYour agent only need one tool: OmniTool. Control a Windows 11 VM with OmniParser + your vision model of choice. OmniTool supports out of the box the following large language models - OpenAI (4o/o1/o3-mini), DeepSeek (R1), Qwen (2.5VL) or Anthropic Computer Use. Check out our github repo for details.\nResponsible AI Considerations\nIntended Use\nOmniParser is designed to be able to convert unstructured screenshot image into structured list of elements including interactable regions location and captions of icons on its potential functionality.\nOmniParser is intended to be used in settings where users are already trained on responsible analytic approaches and critical reasoning is expected. OmniParser is capable of providing extracted information from the screenshot, however human judgement is needed for the output of OmniParser.\nOmniParser is intended to be used on various screenshots, which includes both PC and Phone, and also on various applications.\nlimitations\nOmniParser is designed to faithfully convert screenshot image into structured elements of interactable regions and semantics of the screen, while it does not detect harmful content in its input (like users have freedom to decide the input of any LLMs), users are expected to provide input to the OmniParser that is not harmful.\nWhile OmniParser only converts screenshot image into texts, it can be used to construct an GUI agent based on LLMs that is actionable. When developing and operating the agent using OmniParser, the developers need to be responsible and follow common safety standard.\nLicense\nPlease note that icon_detect model is under AGPL license, and icon_caption is under MIT license.

Load your characters in it, connect to KoboldCPP and start chatting.\nMikuPad: https://lmg-anon.github.io/mikupad/mikupad.html — Want to understand how LLMs work in a minute? Use this to talk directly to the model without characters and system prompts in the way. I use it all the time to test how the model talks and responds to prompts on its own, and what it can or can't do.\nComfyUI: https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI / https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager — My image generation software of choice. Node based, not really beginner friendly, but it's pretty powerful, you have control over every single generation step.\nText Generation Models\nThese days I just really use bigger models via API. With Deepseek and GLM, it has become much more accessible, and it's hard to go back to local, smaller models. Still, these are the ones I used the most:\nMistral Small Instruct 2409: https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-Instruct-2409 — Are these Small models really 20B? They feel a lot smarter than they should. I used this model a lot, but the prose is pretty bland, and it needs a well thought-out prompt to RP well. I prefer blandness to sacrificing smartness for a finetune.\nMagistral Small 2509: https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Magistral-Small-2509 — The more up-to-date version of the same model.\nGemma 2 9B IT: https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2-9b-it — It's an impressive model, has a fantastic prose for such a small size, feels better than even 12B models. But it's pretty censored by default, you'll need to jailbreak it for not-so-wholesome RPs. And don't go beyond 12K context, the model will break.\nCydonia-v1.2-Magnum-v4-22B: https://huggingface.co/knifeayumu/Cydonia-v1.2-Magnum-v4-22B — Magnum V2 and V3 were great models, while V4 was kind of a miss. But for some reason, merging it with Cydonia made Cydonia even better? Go figure.\nMN 12B Mag Mell R1: https://huggingface.co/inflatebot/MN-12B-Mag-Mell-R1 — Best 12B model for RP to date, imo, as smart as a 12B Mistral based model can be.\nWayfarer 12B: https://huggingface.co/LatitudeGames/Wayfarer-12B — Curious model, not the best for general RP, but shines if you like the AI Dungeon format, it was trained for that.\nWayfarer 2 12B: https://huggingface.co/LatitudeGames/Wayfarer-2-12B — The more up-to-date version of the same model.\nImage Generation Models\nNoobAI-XL V-Pred: https://huggingface.co/Laxhar — I used to use merges for a long time, but these days, I just use the base model and apply LORAs to change the style when I want. V-Pred models are a bit harder to work with, and have way less content for them, but they follow prompts better and have significantly better contrast and blacks. It's really cool to experiment with lighting when using them.\nΣΙΗ: https://civitai.com/models/1217645/sih — What the hell, how do you read that? I just call it sigma. Another NoobAI merge. Still testing it, but I feel like it's a big improvement over CyberFix, it's taken its place for now.\nNoobAICyberFix: https://civitai.com/models/913998/noobaicyberfix — NoobAI is one of the latest efforts for anime-style, could easily replace Pony as the standard.

Gemma 3 has a large, 128K context window, multilingual support in over\n140 languages, and is available in more sizes than previous versions. Gemma 3\nmodels are well-suited for a variety of text generation and image understanding\ntasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their\nrelatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with\nlimited resources such as laptops, desktops or your own cloud infrastructure,\ndemocratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation\nfor everyone.\nUsage\nBelow, there are some code snippets on how to get quickly started with running the model. First, install the Transformers library. Gemma 3 is supported starting from transformers 4.50.0.\n$ pip install -U transformers\nThen, copy the snippet from the section that is relevant for your use case.\nRunning with the pipeline API\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nimport torch\npipe = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=\"google/gemma-3-1b-pt\", device=\"cuda\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)\noutput = pipe(\"Eiffel tower is located in\", max_new_tokens=50)\nRunning the model on a single / multi GPU\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, Gemma3ForCausalLM\nckpt = \"google/gemma-3-1b-pt\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(ckpt)\nmodel = Gemma3ForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nckpt,\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\nprompt = \"Eiffel tower is located in\"\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\ninput_len = model_inputs[\"input_ids\"].shape[-1]\nwith torch.inference_mode():\ngeneration = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=50, do_sample=False)\ngeneration = generation[0][input_len:]\ndecoded = tokenizer.decode(generation, skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(decoded)\nInputs and outputs\nInput:\nText string, such as a question, a prompt, or a document to be summarized\nImages, normalized to 896 x 896 resolution and encoded to 256 tokens\neach\nTotal input context of 128K tokens for the 4B, 12B, and 27B sizes, and\n32K tokens for the 1B size\nOutput:\nGenerated text in response to the input, such as an answer to a\nquestion, analysis of image content, or a summary of a document\nTotal output context of 8192 tokens\nCitation\n@article{gemma_2025,\ntitle={Gemma 3},\nurl={https://goo.gle/Gemma3Report},\npublisher={Kaggle},\nauthor={Gemma Team},\nyear={2025}\n}\nModel Data\nData used for model training and how the data was processed.\nTraining Dataset\nThese models were trained on a dataset of text data that includes a wide variety\nof sources. The 27B model was trained with 14 trillion tokens, the 12B model was\ntrained with 12 trillion tokens, 4B model was trained with 4 trillion tokens and\n1B with 2 trillion tokens. Here are the key components:\nWeb Documents: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is\nexposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. The\ntraining dataset includes content in over 140 languages.\nCode: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and\npatterns of programming languages, which improves its ability to generate\ncode and understand code-related questions.\nMathematics: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn logical\nreasoning, symbolic representation, and to address mathematical queries.\nImages: A wide range of images enables the model to perform image\nanalysis and visual data extraction tasks.\nThe combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful\nmultimodal model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and data\nformats.\nData Preprocessing\nHere are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training\ndata:\nCSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering\nwas applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure\nthe exclusion of harmful and illegal content.\nSensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models\nsafe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain\npersonal information and other sensitive data from training sets.\nAdditional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in\nline with our policies.\nImplementation Information\nDetails about the model internals.\nHardware\nGemma was trained using Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware (TPUv4p,\nTPUv5p and TPUv5e). Training vision-language models (VLMS) requires significant\ncomputational power. TPUs, designed specifically for matrix operations common in\nmachine learning, offer several advantages in this domain:\nPerformance: TPUs are specifically designed to handle the massive\ncomputations involved in training VLMs. They can speed up training\nconsiderably compared to CPUs.\nMemory: TPUs often come with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,\nallowing for the handling of large models and batch sizes during training.\nThis can lead to better model quality.\nScalability: TPU Pods (large clusters of TPUs) provide a scalable\nsolution for handling the growing complexity of large foundation models.\nYou can distribute training across multiple TPU devices for faster and more\nefficient processing.\nCost-effectiveness: In many scenarios, TPUs can provide a more\ncost-effective solution for training large models compared to CPU-based\ninfrastructure, especially when considering the time and resources saved\ndue to faster training.\nThese advantages are aligned with\nGoogle's commitments to operate sustainably.\nSoftware\nTraining was done using JAX and ML Pathways.\nJAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,\nincluding TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models. ML\nPathways is Google's latest effort to build artificially intelligent systems\ncapable of generalizing across multiple tasks. This is specially suitable for\nfoundation models, including large language models like these ones.\nTogether, JAX and ML Pathways are used as described in the\npaper about the Gemini family of models; \"the 'single\ncontroller' programming model of Jax and Pathways allows a single Python\nprocess to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying the\ndevelopment workflow.\"\nEvaluation\nModel evaluation metrics and results.\nBenchmark Results\nThese models were evaluated against a large collection of different datasets and\nmetrics to cover different aspects of text generation:\nReasoning and factuality\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 3 PT 1B\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nHellaSwag\n10-shot\n62.3\n77.2\n84.2\n85.6\nBoolQ\n0-shot\n63.2\n72.3\n78.8\n82.4\nPIQA\n0-shot\n73.8\n79.6\n81.8\n83.3\nSocialIQA\n0-shot\n48.9\n51.9\n53.4\n54.9\nTriviaQA\n5-shot\n39.8\n65.8\n78.2\n85.5\nNatural Questions\n5-shot\n9.48\n20.0\n31.4\n36.1\nARC-c\n25-shot\n38.4\n56.2\n68.9\n70.6\nARC-e\n0-shot\n73.0\n82.4\n88.3\n89.0\nWinoGrande\n5-shot\n58.2\n64.7\n74.3\n78.8\nBIG-Bench Hard\nfew-shot\n28.4\n50.9\n72.6\n77.7\nDROP\n1-shot\n42.4\n60.1\n72.2\n77.2\nSTEM and code\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nMMLU\n5-shot\n59.6\n74.5\n78.6\nMMLU (Pro COT)\n5-shot\n29.2\n45.3\n52.2\nAGIEval\n3-5-shot\n42.1\n57.4\n66.2\nMATH\n4-shot\n24.2\n43.3\n50.0\nGSM8K\n8-shot\n38.4\n71.0\n82.6\nGPQA\n5-shot\n15.0\n25.4\n24.3\nMBPP\n3-shot\n46.0\n60.4\n65.6\nHumanEval\n0-shot\n36.0\n45.7\n48.8\nMultilingual\nBenchmark\nGemma 3 PT 1B\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nMGSM\n2.04\n34.7\n64.3\n74.3\nGlobal-MMLU-Lite\n24.9\n57.0\n69.4\n75.7\nWMT24++ (ChrF)\n36.7\n48.4\n53.9\n55.7\nFloRes\n29.5\n39.2\n46.0\n48.8\nXQuAD (all)\n43.9\n68.0\n74.5\n76.8\nECLeKTic\n4.69\n11.0\n17.2\n24.4\nIndicGenBench\n41.4\n57.2\n61.7\n63.4\nMultimodal\nBenchmark\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nCOCOcap\n102\n111\n116\nDocVQA (val)\n72.8\n82.3\n85.6\nInfoVQA (val)\n44.1\n54.8\n59.4\nMMMU (pt)\n39.2\n50.3\n56.1\nTextVQA (val)\n58.9\n66.5\n68.6\nRealWorldQA\n45.5\n52.2\n53.9\nReMI\n27.3\n38.5\n44.8\nAI2D\n63.2\n75.2\n79.0\nChartQA\n63.6\n74.7\n76.3\nVQAv2\n63.9\n71.2\n72.9\nBLINK\n38.0\n35.9\n39.6\nOKVQA\n51.0\n58.7\n60.2\nTallyQA\n42.5\n51.8\n54.3\nSpatialSense VQA\n50.9\n60.0\n59.4\nCountBenchQA\n26.1\n17.8\n68.0\nEthics and Safety\nEthics and safety evaluation approach and results.\nEvaluation Approach\nOur evaluation methods include structured evaluations and internal red-teaming\ntesting of relevant content policies. Red-teaming was conducted by a number of\ndifferent teams, each with different goals and human evaluation metrics. These\nmodels were evaluated against a number of different categories relevant to\nethics and safety, including:\nChild Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\ncovering child safety policies, including child sexual abuse and\nexploitation.\nContent Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\ncovering safety policies including, harassment, violence and gore, and hate\nspeech.\nRepresentational Harms: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text\nprompts covering safety policies including bias, stereotyping, and harmful\nassociations or inaccuracies.\nIn addition to development level evaluations, we conduct \"assurance\nevaluations\" which are our 'arms-length' internal evaluations for responsibility\ngovernance decision making. They are conducted separately from the model\ndevelopment team, to inform decision making about release. High level findings\nare fed back to the model team, but prompt sets are held-out to prevent\noverfitting and preserve the results' ability to inform decision making.\nAssurance evaluation results are reported to our Responsibility & Safety Council\nas part of release review.\nEvaluation Results\nFor all areas of safety testing, we saw major improvements in the categories of\nchild safety, content safety, and representational harms relative to previous\nGemma models. All testing was conducted without safety filters to evaluate the\nmodel capabilities and behaviors. For both text-to-text and image-to-text, and\nacross all model sizes, the model produced minimal policy violations, and showed\nsignificant improvements over previous Gemma models' performance with respect\nto ungrounded inferences. A limitation of our evaluations was they included only\nEnglish language prompts.\nUsage and Limitations\nThese models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.\nIntended Usage\nOpen vision-language models (VLMs) models have a wide range of applications\nacross various industries and domains. The following list of potential uses is\nnot comprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development.\nContent Creation and Communication\nText Generation: These models can be used to generate creative text\nformats such as poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.\nChatbots and Conversational AI: Power conversational interfaces\nfor customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.\nText Summarization: Generate concise summaries of a text corpus,\nresearch papers, or reports.\nImage Data Extraction: These models can be used to extract,\ninterpret, and summarize visual data for text communications.\nResearch and Education\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and VLM Research: These\nmodels can serve as a foundation for researchers to experiment with VLM\nand NLP techniques, develop algorithms, and contribute to the\nadvancement of the field.\nLanguage Learning Tools: Support interactive language learning\nexperiences, aiding in grammar correction or providing writing practice.\nKnowledge Exploration: Assist researchers in exploring large\nbodies of text by generating summaries or answering questions about\nspecific topics.\nLimitations\nTraining Data\nThe quality and diversity of the training data significantly\ninfluence the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data\ncan lead to limitations in the model's responses.\nThe scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas\nthe model can handle effectively.\nContext and Task Complexity\nModels are better at tasks that can be framed with clear\nprompts and instructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be\nchallenging.\nA model's performance can be influenced by the amount of context\nprovided (longer context generally leads to better outputs, up to a\ncertain point).\nLanguage Ambiguity and Nuance\nNatural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle\nto grasp subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\nFactual Accuracy\nModels generate responses based on information they learned\nfrom their training datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They\nmay generate incorrect or outdated factual statements.\nCommon Sense\nModels rely on statistical patterns in language. They might\nlack the ability to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.\nEthical Considerations and Risks\nThe development of vision-language models (VLMs) raises several ethical\nconcerns. In creating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:\nBias and Fairness\nVLMs trained on large-scale, real-world text and image data can\nreflect socio-cultural biases embedded in the training material. These\nmodels underwent careful scrutiny, input data pre-processing described\nand posterior evaluations reported in this card.\nMisinformation and Misuse\nVLMs can be misused to generate text that is false, misleading,\nor harmful.\nGuidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the\nResponsible Generative AI Toolkit.\nTransparency and Accountability:\nThis model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,\ncapabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.\nA responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to\nshare innovation by making VLM technology accessible to developers and\nresearchers across the AI ecosystem.\nRisks identified and mitigations:\nPerpetuation of biases: It's encouraged to perform continuous\nmonitoring (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of\nde-biasing techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use\ncases.\nGeneration of harmful content: Mechanisms and guidelines for content\nsafety are essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and\nimplement appropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific\nproduct policies and application use cases.\nMisuse for malicious purposes: Technical limitations and developer\nand end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of\nVLMs. Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag\nmisuse are provided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the\nGemma Prohibited Use Policy.\nPrivacy violations: Models were trained on data filtered for removal\nof certain personal information and other sensitive data. Developers are\nencouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving\ntechniques.\nBenefits\nAt the time of release, this family of models provides high-performance open\nvision-language model implementations designed from the ground up for\nresponsible AI development compared to similarly sized models.\nUsing the benchmark evaluation metrics described in this document, these models\nhave shown to provide superior performance to other, comparably-sized open model\nalternatives.",
    "moonshotai/Moonlight-16B-A3B-Instruct": "Abstract\nKey Ingredients\nPerformance\nExample usage\nModel Download\nInference with Hugging Face Transformers\nCitation\nTech Report  |\nHuggingFace  |\nMegatron(coming soon)\nAbstract\nRecently, the Muon optimizer has demonstrated strong results in training small-scale language models, but the scalability to larger models has not been proven. We identify two crucial techniques for scaling up Muon:\nWeight Decay: Critical for scaling to larger models\nConsistent RMS Updates: Enforcing a consistent root mean square on model updates\nThese techniques allow Muon to work out-of-the-box on large-scale training without the need of hyper-parameter tuning. Scaling law experiments indicate that Muon is $\\sim2\\times$ more sample efficient than Adam with compute optimal training.\nBased on these improvements, we introduce Moonlight, a 3B/16B-parameter Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) model trained with 5.7T tokens using Muon. Our model improves the current Pareto frontier, achieving better performance with much fewer training FLOPs compared to prior models.\nWe open-source our Muon implementation that is memory optimal and communication efficient. We also release the pretrained, instruction-tuned, and intermediate checkpoints to support future research.\nOur code is available at MoonshotAI/Moonlight.\nKey Ingredients\nOur work builds upon Muon while systematically identifying and resolving its limitations in large-scale training scenarios. Our technical contributions include:\nAnalysis for Effective Scaling of Muon: Through extensive analysis, we identify that weight decay plays a crucial roles in Muon's scalability. Besides, we proposed to keep a consistent update root mean square (RMS) across different matrix and non-matrix parameters through parameter-wise update scale adjustments. Such adjustments significantly enhanced training stability.\nEfficient Distributed Implementation: We develop a distributed version of Muon with ZeRO-1 style optimization, achieving optimal memory efficiency and reduced communication overhead while preserving the mathematical properties of the algorithm.\nScaling Law Validation: We performed scaling law research that compares Muon with strong AdamW baselines, and showed the superior performance of Muon (see Figure 1). Based on the scaling law results, Muon achieves comparable performance to AdamW trained counterparts while requiring only approximately 52% of the training FLOPs.\nScaling up with Muon. (a) Scaling law experiments comparing Muon and Adam. Muon is 2 times more sample efficient than Adam. (b) The MMLU performance of our Moonlight model optimized with Muon and other comparable models.

The tokenizer files already provide placeholder tokens that can be used for downstream fine-tuning, but they can also be extended up to the model's vocabulary size.\nInput Formats\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-4-mini-instruct\nmodel is best suited for prompts using specific formats.\nBelow are the two primary formats:\nChat format\nThis format is used for general conversation and instructions:\n<|system|>Insert System Message<|end|><|user|>Insert User Message<|end|><|assistant|>\nTool-enabled function-calling format\nThis format is used when the user wants the model to provide function calls based on the given tools. The user should provide the available tools in the system prompt, wrapped by <|tool|> and <|/tool|> tokens. The tools should be specified in JSON format, using a JSON dump structure. Example:\n<|system|>You are a helpful assistant with some tools.<|tool|>[{\"name\": \"get_weather_updates\", \"description\": \"Fetches weather updates for a given city using the RapidAPI Weather API.\", \"parameters\": {\"city\": {\"description\": \"The name of the city for which to retrieve weather information.\", \"type\": \"str\", \"default\": \"London\"}}}]<|/tool|><|end|><|user|>What is the weather like in Paris today?<|end|><|assistant|>\nInference with vLLM\nRequirements\nList of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.7.4.post1\ntorch==2.6.0\nvllm>=0.7.2\nExample\nTo perform inference using vLLM, you can use the following code snippet:\nfrom vllm import LLM, SamplingParams\nllm = LLM(model=\"microsoft/Phi-4-mini-instruct\", trust_remote_code=True)\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful AI assistant.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you provide ways to eat combinations of bananas and dragonfruits?\"},\n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Sure! Here are some ways to eat bananas and dragonfruits together: 1. Banana and dragonfruit smoothie: Blend bananas and dragonfruits together with some milk and honey. 2. Banana and dragonfruit salad: Mix sliced bananas and dragonfruits together with some lemon juice and honey.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What about solving an 2x + 3 = 7 equation?\"},\n]\nsampling_params = SamplingParams(\nmax_tokens=500,\ntemperature=0.0,\n)\noutput = llm.chat(messages=messages, sampling_params=sampling_params)\nprint(output[0].outputs[0].text)\nInference with Transformers\nRequirements\nPhi-4 family has been integrated in the 4.49.0 version of transformers. The current transformers version can be verified with: pip list | grep transformers.\nList of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.7.4.post1\ntorch==2.6.0\ntransformers==4.49.0\naccelerate==1.3.0\nPhi-4-mini-instruct is also available in Azure AI Studio\nExample\nAfter obtaining the Phi-4-mini-instruct model checkpoints, users can use this sample code for inference.\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline\ntorch.random.manual_seed(0)\nmodel_path = \"microsoft/Phi-4-mini-instruct\"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_path,\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ntrust_remote_code=True,\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful AI assistant.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you provide ways to eat combinations of bananas and dragonfruits?\"},\n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Sure! Here are some ways to eat bananas and dragonfruits together: 1. Banana and dragonfruit smoothie: Blend bananas and dragonfruits together with some milk and honey. 2. Banana and dragonfruit salad: Mix sliced bananas and dragonfruits together with some lemon juice and honey.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What about solving an 2x + 3 = 7 equation?\"},\n]\npipe = pipeline(\n\"text-generation\",\nmodel=model,\ntokenizer=tokenizer,\n)\ngeneration_args = {\n\"max_new_tokens\": 500,\n\"return_full_text\": False,\n\"temperature\": 0.0,\n\"do_sample\": False,\n}\noutput = pipe(messages, **generation_args)\nprint(output[0]['generated_text'])\nResponsible AI Considerations\nLike other language models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include:\nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text and some additional multilingual text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance as well as performance disparities across non-English. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English.\nMultilingual performance and safety gaps: We believe it is important to make language models more widely available across different languages, but the Phi 4 models still exhibit challenges common across multilingual releases. As with any deployment of LLMs, developers will be better positioned to test for performance or safety gaps for their linguistic and cultural context and customize the model with additional fine-tuning and appropriate safeguards.\nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups, cultural contexts, or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases.\nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the case.\nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated.\nLimited Scope for Code: The majority of Phi 4 training data is based in Python and uses common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, it is  strongly recommended that users manually verify all API uses.\nLong Conversation: Phi 4 models, like other models, can in some cases generate responses that are repetitive, unhelpful, or inconsistent in very long chat sessions in both English and non-English languages. Developers are encouraged to place appropriate mitigations, like limiting conversation turns to account for the possible conversational drift.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices, including mapping, measuring, and mitigating risks associated with their specific use case and cultural, linguistic context. Phi 4 family of models are general purpose models. As developers plan to deploy these models for specific use cases, they are encouraged to fine-tune the models for their use case and leverage the models as part of broader AI systems with language-specific safeguards in place. Important areas for consideration include:\nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess the suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nTraining\nModel\nArchitecture: Phi-4-mini-instruct has 3.8B parameters and is a dense decoder-only Transformer model. When compared with Phi-3.5-mini, the major changes with Phi-4-mini-instruct are 200K vocabulary, grouped-query attention, and shared input and output embedding.\nInputs: Text. It is best suited for prompts using the chat format.\nContext length: 128K tokens\nGPUs: 512 A100-80G\nTraining time: 21 days\nTraining data: 5T tokens\nOutputs: Generated text in response to the input\nDates: Trained between November and December 2024\nStatus: This is a static model trained on offline datasets with the cutoff date of June 2024 for publicly available data.\nSupported languages: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian\nRelease date: February 2025\nTraining Datasets\nPhi-4-mini’s training data includes a wide variety of sources, totaling 5 trillion tokens, and is a combination of\npublicly available documents filtered for quality, selected high-quality educational data, and code\nnewly created synthetic, “textbook-like” data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (e.g., science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.)\nhigh quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness. Focus was placed on the quality of data that could potentially improve the reasoning ability for the model, and the publicly available documents were filtered to contain a preferred level of knowledge. As an example, the result of a game in premier league on a particular day might be good training data for frontier models, but such information was removed to leave more model capacity for reasoning for the model’s small size. More details about data can be found in the Phi-4-mini-instruct technical report.\nThe decontamination process involved normalizing and tokenizing the dataset, then generating and comparing n-grams between the target dataset and benchmark datasets. Samples with matching n-grams above a threshold were flagged as contaminated and removed from the dataset. A detailed contamination report was generated, summarizing the matched text, matching ratio, and filtered results for further analysis.\nFine-tuning\nA basic example of multi-GPUs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with TRL and Accelerate modules is provided here.\nSafety Evaluation and Red-Teaming\nVarious evaluation techniques including red teaming, adversarial conversation simulations, and multilingual safety evaluation benchmark datasets were leveraged to evaluate Phi-4 models’ propensity to produce undesirable outputs across multiple languages and risk categories. Several approaches were used to compensate for the limitations of one approach alone. Findings across the various evaluation methods indicate that safety post-training that was done as detailed in the Phi 3 Safety Post-Training paper had a positive impact across multiple languages and risk categories as observed by refusal rates (refusal to output undesirable outputs) and robustness to jailbreak techniques. Details on prior red team evaluations across Phi models can be found in the Phi 3 Safety Post-Training paper. For this release, the red team tested the model in English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Thai, and Russian for the following potential harms: Hate Speech and Bias, Violent Crimes, Specialized Advice, and Election Information. Their findings indicate that the model is resistant to jailbreak techniques across languages, but that language-specific attack prompts leveraging cultural context can cause the model to output harmful content. Another insight was that with function calling scenarios, the model could sometimes hallucinate function names or URL’s.  The model may also be more susceptible to longer multi-turn jailbreak techniques across both English and non-English languages. These findings highlight the need for industry-wide investment in the development of high-quality safety evaluation datasets across multiple languages, including low resource languages, and risk areas that account for cultural nuances where those languages are spoken.\nSoftware\nPyTorch\nTransformers\nFlash-Attention\nHardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-4-mini-instruct model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run. We have tested on the following GPU types:\nNVIDIA A100\nNVIDIA A6000\nNVIDIA H100\nIf you want to run the model on:\nNVIDIA V100 or earlier generation GPUs: call AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained() with attn_implementation=\"eager\"\nLicense\nThe model is licensed under the MIT license.\nTrademarks\nThis project may contain trademarks or logos for projects, products, or services.

Any use of third-party trademarks or logos are subject to those third-party’s policies.\nAppendix A: Benchmark Methodology\nWe include a brief word on methodology here - and in particular, how we think about optimizing prompts.\nIn an ideal world, we would never change any prompts in our benchmarks to ensure it is always an apples-to-apples comparison when comparing different models. Indeed, this is our default approach, and is the case in the vast majority of models we have run to date.\nThere are, however, some exceptions to this. In some cases, we see a model that performs worse than expected on a given eval due to a failure to respect the output format. For example:\nA model may refuse to answer questions (for no apparent reason), or in coding tasks models may prefix their response with “Sure, I can help with that. …” which may break the parser. In such cases, we have opted to try different system messages (e.g. “You must always respond to a question” or “Get to the point!”).\nWith some models, we observed that few shots actually hurt model performance. In this case we did allow running the benchmarks with 0-shots for all cases.\nWe have tools to convert between chat and completions APIs. When converting a chat prompt to a completion prompt, some models have different keywords e.g. Human vs User. In these cases, we do allow for model-specific mappings for chat to completion prompts.\nHowever, we do not:\nPick different few-shot examples. Few shots will always be the same when comparing different models.\nChange prompt format: e.g. if it is an A/B/C/D multiple choice, we do not tweak this to 1/2/3/4 multiple choice.\nBenchmark datasets\nThe model was evaluated across a breadth of public and internal benchmarks to understand the model’s capabilities under multiple tasks and conditions. While most evaluations use English, the leading multilingual benchmark was incorporated that covers performance in select languages.

Gemma 3 has a large, 128K context window, multilingual support in over\n140 languages, and is available in more sizes than previous versions. Gemma 3\nmodels are well-suited for a variety of text generation and image understanding\ntasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning.

The 27B model was trained with 14 trillion tokens, the 12B model was\ntrained with 12 trillion tokens, 4B model was trained with 4 trillion tokens and\n1B with 2 trillion tokens. Here are the key components:\nWeb Documents: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is\nexposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. The\ntraining dataset includes content in over 140 languages.\nCode: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and\npatterns of programming languages, which improves its ability to generate\ncode and understand code-related questions.\nMathematics: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn logical\nreasoning, symbolic representation, and to address mathematical queries.\nImages: A wide range of images enables the model to perform image\nanalysis and visual data extraction tasks.\nThe combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful\nmultimodal model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and data\nformats.\nData Preprocessing\nHere are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training\ndata:\nCSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering\nwas applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure\nthe exclusion of harmful and illegal content.\nSensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models\nsafe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain\npersonal information and other sensitive data from training sets.\nAdditional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in\nline with our policies.\nImplementation Information\nDetails about the model internals.\nHardware\nGemma was trained using Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware (TPUv4p,\nTPUv5p and TPUv5e). Training vision-language models (VLMS) requires significant\ncomputational power. TPUs, designed specifically for matrix operations common in\nmachine learning, offer several advantages in this domain:\nPerformance: TPUs are specifically designed to handle the massive\ncomputations involved in training VLMs. They can speed up training\nconsiderably compared to CPUs.\nMemory: TPUs often come with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,\nallowing for the handling of large models and batch sizes during training.\nThis can lead to better model quality.\nScalability: TPU Pods (large clusters of TPUs) provide a scalable\nsolution for handling the growing complexity of large foundation models.\nYou can distribute training across multiple TPU devices for faster and more\nefficient processing.\nCost-effectiveness: In many scenarios, TPUs can provide a more\ncost-effective solution for training large models compared to CPU-based\ninfrastructure, especially when considering the time and resources saved\ndue to faster training.\nThese advantages are aligned with\nGoogle's commitments to operate sustainably.\nSoftware\nTraining was done using JAX and ML Pathways.\nJAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,\nincluding TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models. ML\nPathways is Google's latest effort to build artificially intelligent systems\ncapable of generalizing across multiple tasks. This is specially suitable for\nfoundation models, including large language models like these ones.\nTogether, JAX and ML Pathways are used as described in the\npaper about the Gemini family of models; \"the 'single\ncontroller' programming model of Jax and Pathways allows a single Python\nprocess to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying the\ndevelopment workflow.\"\nEvaluation\nModel evaluation metrics and results.\nBenchmark Results\nThese models were evaluated against a large collection of different datasets and\nmetrics to cover different aspects of text generation:\nReasoning and factuality\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 3 PT 1B\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nHellaSwag\n10-shot\n62.3\n77.2\n84.2\n85.6\nBoolQ\n0-shot\n63.2\n72.3\n78.8\n82.4\nPIQA\n0-shot\n73.8\n79.6\n81.8\n83.3\nSocialIQA\n0-shot\n48.9\n51.9\n53.4\n54.9\nTriviaQA\n5-shot\n39.8\n65.8\n78.2\n85.5\nNatural Questions\n5-shot\n9.48\n20.0\n31.4\n36.1\nARC-c\n25-shot\n38.4\n56.2\n68.9\n70.6\nARC-e\n0-shot\n73.0\n82.4\n88.3\n89.0\nWinoGrande\n5-shot\n58.2\n64.7\n74.3\n78.8\nBIG-Bench Hard\nfew-shot\n28.4\n50.9\n72.6\n77.7\nDROP\n1-shot\n42.4\n60.1\n72.2\n77.2\nSTEM and code\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nMMLU\n5-shot\n59.6\n74.5\n78.6\nMMLU (Pro COT)\n5-shot\n29.2\n45.3\n52.2\nAGIEval\n3-5-shot\n42.1\n57.4\n66.2\nMATH\n4-shot\n24.2\n43.3\n50.0\nGSM8K\n8-shot\n38.4\n71.0\n82.6\nGPQA\n5-shot\n15.0\n25.4\n24.3\nMBPP\n3-shot\n46.0\n60.4\n65.6\nHumanEval\n0-shot\n36.0\n45.7\n48.8\nMultilingual\nBenchmark\nGemma 3 PT 1B\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nMGSM\n2.04\n34.7\n64.3\n74.3\nGlobal-MMLU-Lite\n24.9\n57.0\n69.4\n75.7\nWMT24++ (ChrF)\n36.7\n48.4\n53.9\n55.7\nFloRes\n29.5\n39.2\n46.0\n48.8\nXQuAD (all)\n43.9\n68.0\n74.5\n76.8\nECLeKTic\n4.69\n11.0\n17.2\n24.4\nIndicGenBench\n41.4\n57.2\n61.7\n63.4\nMultimodal\nBenchmark\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nCOCOcap\n102\n111\n116\nDocVQA (val)\n72.8\n82.3\n85.6\nInfoVQA (val)\n44.1\n54.8\n59.4\nMMMU (pt)\n39.2\n50.3\n56.1\nTextVQA (val)\n58.9\n66.5\n68.6\nRealWorldQA\n45.5\n52.2\n53.9\nReMI\n27.3\n38.5\n44.8\nAI2D\n63.2\n75.2\n79.0\nChartQA\n63.6\n74.7\n76.3\nVQAv2\n63.9\n71.2\n72.9\nBLINK\n38.0\n35.9\n39.6\nOKVQA\n51.0\n58.7\n60.2\nTallyQA\n42.5\n51.8\n54.3\nSpatialSense VQA\n50.9\n60.0\n59.4\nCountBenchQA\n26.1\n17.8\n68.0\nEthics and Safety\nEthics and safety evaluation approach and results.\nEvaluation Approach\nOur evaluation methods include structured evaluations and internal red-teaming\ntesting of relevant content policies. Red-teaming was conducted by a number of\ndifferent teams, each with different goals and human evaluation metrics. These\nmodels were evaluated against a number of different categories relevant to\nethics and safety, including:\nChild Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\ncovering child safety policies, including child sexual abuse and\nexploitation.\nContent Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\ncovering safety policies including, harassment, violence and gore, and hate\nspeech.\nRepresentational Harms: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text\nprompts covering safety policies including bias, stereotyping, and harmful\nassociations or inaccuracies.\nIn addition to development level evaluations, we conduct \"assurance\nevaluations\" which are our 'arms-length' internal evaluations for responsibility\ngovernance decision making. They are conducted separately from the model\ndevelopment team, to inform decision making about release. High level findings\nare fed back to the model team, but prompt sets are held-out to prevent\noverfitting and preserve the results' ability to inform decision making.\nAssurance evaluation results are reported to our Responsibility & Safety Council\nas part of release review.\nEvaluation Results\nFor all areas of safety testing, we saw major improvements in the categories of\nchild safety, content safety, and representational harms relative to previous\nGemma models. All testing was conducted without safety filters to evaluate the\nmodel capabilities and behaviors. For both text-to-text and image-to-text, and\nacross all model sizes, the model produced minimal policy violations, and showed\nsignificant improvements over previous Gemma models' performance with respect\nto ungrounded inferences. A limitation of our evaluations was they included only\nEnglish language prompts.\nUsage and Limitations\nThese models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.\nIntended Usage\nOpen vision-language models (VLMs) models have a wide range of applications\nacross various industries and domains. The following list of potential uses is\nnot comprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development.\nContent Creation and Communication\nText Generation: These models can be used to generate creative text\nformats such as poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.\nChatbots and Conversational AI: Power conversational interfaces\nfor customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.\nText Summarization: Generate concise summaries of a text corpus,\nresearch papers, or reports.\nImage Data Extraction: These models can be used to extract,\ninterpret, and summarize visual data for text communications.\nResearch and Education\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and VLM Research: These\nmodels can serve as a foundation for researchers to experiment with VLM\nand NLP techniques, develop algorithms, and contribute to the\nadvancement of the field.\nLanguage Learning Tools: Support interactive language learning\nexperiences, aiding in grammar correction or providing writing practice.\nKnowledge Exploration: Assist researchers in exploring large\nbodies of text by generating summaries or answering questions about\nspecific topics.\nLimitations\nTraining Data\nThe quality and diversity of the training data significantly\ninfluence the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data\ncan lead to limitations in the model's responses.\nThe scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas\nthe model can handle effectively.\nContext and Task Complexity\nModels are better at tasks that can be framed with clear\nprompts and instructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be\nchallenging.\nA model's performance can be influenced by the amount of context\nprovided (longer context generally leads to better outputs, up to a\ncertain point).\nLanguage Ambiguity and Nuance\nNatural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle\nto grasp subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\nFactual Accuracy\nModels generate responses based on information they learned\nfrom their training datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They\nmay generate incorrect or outdated factual statements.\nCommon Sense\nModels rely on statistical patterns in language. They might\nlack the ability to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.\nEthical Considerations and Risks\nThe development of vision-language models (VLMs) raises several ethical\nconcerns. In creating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:\nBias and Fairness\nVLMs trained on large-scale, real-world text and image data can\nreflect socio-cultural biases embedded in the training material. These\nmodels underwent careful scrutiny, input data pre-processing described\nand posterior evaluations reported in this card.\nMisinformation and Misuse\nVLMs can be misused to generate text that is false, misleading,\nor harmful.\nGuidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the\nResponsible Generative AI Toolkit.\nTransparency and Accountability:\nThis model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,\ncapabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.\nA responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to\nshare innovation by making VLM technology accessible to developers and\nresearchers across the AI ecosystem.\nRisks identified and mitigations:\nPerpetuation of biases: It's encouraged to perform continuous\nmonitoring (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of\nde-biasing techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use\ncases.\nGeneration of harmful content: Mechanisms and guidelines for content\nsafety are essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and\nimplement appropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific\nproduct policies and application use cases.\nMisuse for malicious purposes: Technical limitations and developer\nand end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of\nVLMs. Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag\nmisuse are provided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the\nGemma Prohibited Use Policy.\nPrivacy violations: Models were trained on data filtered for removal\nof certain personal information and other sensitive data. Developers are\nencouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving\ntechniques.\nBenefits\nAt the time of release, this family of models provides high-performance open\nvision-language model implementations designed from the ground up for\nresponsible AI development compared to similarly sized models.\nUsing the benchmark evaluation metrics described in this document, these models\nhave shown to provide superior performance to other, comparably-sized open model\nalternatives.",

Able to handle my cards with gimmicks and subtle tricks in them. With a good reasoning starter+prompt, I'm getting consistently-structured responses that have a good amount of variation across them still while rerolling. Char/scenario portrayal is good despite my focus on writing style, lorebooks are properly referenced at times. Slop doesn't seem to be too much of an issue with thinking enabled. Some user impersonation is rarely observed. Prose is refreshing if you take advantage of what I did (writing style fixation). I know I said Marigold would be my daily driver, but this one is that now, it's that good.\nRecommended settings\nContext/instruct template: ChatML. Was definitely not tested with ChatML instruct and Mistral v7 template, nuh-uh.\nSamplers: temperature at 0.9, min_p at 0.05, top_a at 0.3, TFS at 0.75, repetition_penalty at 1.03, DRY if you have access to it. (or not, see below.)\nA virt-io derivative prompt worked best during our testing, but feel free to use what you like.\nMaster import for ST: https://files.catbox.moe/w812at.png\nReasoning\nFeel free to test whichever reasoning setup you're most comfortable with, but here's a recommendation from me. My prompt has a line that says:\nStyle Preference: Encourage the usage of a Japanese light novel writing style.\nDeciding to fixate on that, my reasoning starter is:\n<think>Okay, in this scenario, before responding I need to consider the writing style referenced in the prompt, which is\nWhat this did for me, at least during testing is that it gave the reasoning a structure to follow across rerolls, seeking out that part of the prompt consistently.\nSee below:\nBut the responses were still varied, because the next few paragraphs after these delved into character details, so on and so forth. Might want to experiment and make your own thinking/reasoning starter that focuses on what you hope to get out of the responses for best results.\n— Severian\nThank you!\nBig thanks to the folks in the trashpanda-org discord for testing and sending over some logs!\nReviews\nPROS:\nIn 10 swipes, had only two minor instances of speaking for {{user}}. (Can probably be fixed with a good prompt, though.)\nCreativity: 8/10 swipes provided unique text for 90% of the response, almost no cliché phrases.\nTakes personality of characters into account, sticking to it well. Even without a lorebook to support it was able to retain lore-specific terms and actually remember which meant which.\nNPCs: In 6/10 swipes NPC characters also partook in action, sticking to bits of information provided about them in opening message. Some of them even had their unique speech patterns. (Certain with a proper lorebook it would cook.)\nUnfiltered, graphic descriptions of fight scenes. Magic, physical attacks - everything was taken into account with no holding back.\nCONS:\nSome swipes were a bit OOC. Some swipes were bland, providing little to no input or any weight on the roleplay context.\nOut of all models I've tried recently, this one definitely has most potential. With proper prompting I think this beast would be genuinely one of the best models for unique scenarios.\n— Sellvene\nIt's one of the -maybe THE- best small thinking models right now. It sticks to character really well, slops are almost non-existent though they are still there of course, it proceeds with the story well and listens to the prompt. I LOVE R1 but I love snowdrop even more right now because answers feel more geniune and less agressive compared to R1.\n— Carmenta\nWrites better than GPT 4.5. Overall, I think censorship is fucking up more unhinged bots and it's too tame for my liking. Another thing I noticed is that, it's sticking too much to being \"right\" to the character and too afraid to go off the rails.\n— Myscell\nI'm fainting, the character breakdown in it's thinking is similar like R1 does. Character handling looks amazing. Broo if a merge this good then, I'm looking forward to that QwQ finetune.\n— Sam\nNegligible slop, no positivity bias which is good though. I like the model so far, R1 at home.\n— Raihanbook\nOverall, I think this is a real solid model. Cot is great, listens to my prompt extremely well. Number 1 for reasoning, honestly. And the way it portrays the character and persona details? Perfect. Narration, perfect. I have very little complaints about this model, ya'll cooked.\n— Moothdragon\nOn my end, posivity bias isn't really there 🤔 Character and scenario portrayal is good. The prose too, I like it. Between this and Marigold, I feel like I can lean into snowboard (I mean Snowdrop) more. For now though, it is still Marigold.\n— Azula\nHonestly i am impressed and I like it.\n— OMGWTFBBQ\nIt's pretty damn good. Better than Mullein, I think.\n— br\nSo far, it fucking SLAPS.

Please refer to our EXAONE Deep collection to find corresponding quantized models.\nUsage Guideline\nTo achieve the expected performance, we recommend using the following configurations:\nEnsure the model starts with <thought>\\n for reasoning steps. The model's output quality may be degraded when you omit it. You can easily apply this feature by using tokenizer.apply_chat_template() with add_generation_prompt=True. Please check the example code on Quickstart section.\nThe reasoning steps of EXAONE Deep models enclosed by <thought>\\n...\\n</thought> usually have lots of tokens, so previous reasoning steps may be necessary to be removed in multi-turn situation. The provided tokenizer handles this automatically.\nAvoid using system prompt, and build the instruction on the user prompt.\nAdditional instructions help the models reason more deeply, so that the models generate better output.\nFor math problems, the instructions \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" are helpful.\nFor more information on our evaluation setting including prompts, please refer to our Documentation.\nIn our evaluation, we use temperature=0.6 and top_p=0.95 for generation.\nWhen evaluating the models, it is recommended to test multiple times to assess the expected performance accurately.\nLimitation\nThe EXAONE language model has certain limitations and may occasionally generate inappropriate responses. The language model generates responses based on the output probability of tokens, and it is determined during learning from training data. While we have made every effort to exclude personal, harmful, and biased information from the training data, some problematic content may still be included, potentially leading to undesirable responses. Please note that the text generated by EXAONE language model does not reflects the views of LG AI Research.\nInappropriate answers may be generated, which contain personal, harmful or other inappropriate information.\nBiased responses may be generated, which are associated with age, gender, race, and so on.\nThe generated responses rely heavily on statistics from the training data, which can result in the generation of\nsemantically or syntactically incorrect sentences.\nSince the model does not reflect the latest information, the responses may be false or contradictory.\nLG AI Research strives to reduce potential risks that may arise from EXAONE language models. Users are not allowed\nto engage in any malicious activities (e.g., keying in illegal information) that may induce the creation of inappropriate\noutputs violating LG AI’s ethical principles when using EXAONE language models.\nLicense\nThe model is licensed under EXAONE AI Model License Agreement 1.1 - NC\nCitation\n@article{exaone-deep,\ntitle={EXAONE Deep: Reasoning Enhanced Language Models},\nauthor={{LG AI Research}},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.12524},\nyear={2025}\n}\nContact\nLG AI Research Technical Support: contact_us@lgresearch.ai",

Также в отдельном репозитории опубликована квантизованная версия модели в формате GGUF.\nОбучена на базе YandexGPT 5 Lite Pretrain, без использования весов каких-либо сторонних моделей. Алайнмент Lite-версии совпадает с алайнментом YandexGPT 5 Pro и состоит из этапов SFT и RLHF (более подробно о них — в статье на Хабре).\nЗадавайте вопросы в discussions.\nБенчмарки\nПо результатам международных бенчмарков и их адаптаций для русского языка, YandexGPT 5 Lite вплотную приблизилась к аналогам (Llama-3.1-8B-instruct и Qwen-2.5-7B-instruct) и превосходит их в ряде сценариев, в том числе — в знании русской культуры и фактов.\nMMLU — 5-shot, все остальные бенчмарки — 0-shot.\nКак использовать\nМодель можно запустить через HF Transformers:\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nMODEL_NAME = \"yandex/YandexGPT-5-Lite-8B-instruct\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nMODEL_NAME,\ndevice_map=\"cuda\",\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\n)\nmessages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Для чего нужна токенизация?\"}]\ninput_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages, tokenize=True, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n).to(\"cuda\")\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=1024)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0][input_ids.size(1) :], skip_special_tokens=True))\nИли через vLLM:\nfrom vllm import LLM, SamplingParams\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\nMODEL_NAME = \"yandex/YandexGPT-5-Lite-8B-instruct\"\nsampling_params = SamplingParams(\ntemperature=0.3,\ntop_p=0.9,\nmax_tokens=1024,\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)\nllm = LLM(\nMODEL_NAME,\ntensor_parallel_size=1,\n)\nmessages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"В чем смысл жизни?\"}]\ninput_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages, tokenize=True, add_generation_prompt=True\n)[1:]  # remove bos\ntext = tokenizer.decode(input_ids)\noutputs = llm.generate(text, use_tqdm=False, sampling_params=sampling_params)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0].outputs[0].token_ids, skip_special_tokens=True))\nДля запуска в llama.cpp и ollama можно воспользоваться нашей квантизованной моделью, которая выложена в репозитории YandexGPT-5-Lite-8B-instruct-GGUF.\nОсобенности токенизации\nДля полного соответствия токенизации мы рекомендуем пользоваться оригинальным sentencepiece — файл токенизатора лежит в папке original_tokenizer. В нашей инфраструктуре каждую реплику диалога мы токенизируем отдельно.\nИз-за этого, в частности, появляется пробел в начале каждой реплики. Также \\n токены мы заменяем на [NL], это можно сделать с помощью text.replace(\"\\n\", \"[NL]\") перед токенизацией.\nОсобенности шаблона\nМы используем нестандартный шаблон диалога — модель обучена генерировать только одну реплику после последовательности Ассистент:[SEP], завершая её токеном </s>. При этом диалог в промпте может быть любой длины.\nЭто приводит к тому, что в интерактивном режиме модель может выдавать результаты, отличающиеся от вызова модели в режиме генерации на фиксированном диалоге. Поэтому мы рекомендуем использовать интерактивный режим только для ознакомления с моделью.",

Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 4 Community License. Use in languages or capabilities beyond those explicitly referenced as supported in this model card**.\n**Note:\n1. Llama 4 has been trained on a broader collection of languages than the 12 supported languages (pre-training includes 200 total languages). Developers may fine-tune Llama 4 models for languages beyond the 12 supported languages provided they comply with the Llama 4 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy.  Developers are responsible for ensuring that their use of Llama 4 in additional languages is done in a safe and responsible manner.\n2. Llama 4 has been tested for image understanding up to 5 input images. If leveraging additional image understanding capabilities beyond this, Developers are responsible for ensuring that their deployments are mitigated for risks and should perform additional testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors: We used custom training libraries, Meta's custom built GPU clusters, and production infrastructure for pretraining. Fine-tuning, quantization, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on production infrastructure.\nTraining Energy Use:  Model pre-training utilized a cumulative of 7.38M GPU hours of computation on H100-80GB (TDP of 700W) type hardware, per the table below. Training time is the total GPU time required for training each model and power consumption is the peak power capacity per GPU device used, adjusted for power usage efficiency.\nTraining Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Estimated total location-based greenhouse gas emissions were 1,999 tons CO2eq for training. Since 2020, Meta has maintained net zero greenhouse gas emissions in its global operations and matched 100% of its electricity use with clean and renewable energy; therefore, the total market-based greenhouse gas emissions for training were 0 tons CO2eq.\nModel Name\nTraining Time (GPU hours)\nTraining Power Consumption (W)\nTraining Location-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tons CO2eq)\nTraining Market-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tons CO2eq)\nLlama 4 Scout\n5.0M\n700\n1,354\n0\nLlama 4 Maverick\n2.38M\n700\n645\n0\nTotal\n7.38M\n-\n1,999\n0\nThe methodology used to determine training energy use and greenhouse gas emissions can be found here.

This includes publicly shared posts from Instagram and Facebook and people’s interactions with Meta AI.\nData Freshness: The pretraining data has a cutoff of August 2024.\nBenchmarks\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 4 relative to our previous models. We've provided quantized checkpoints for deployment flexibility, but all reported evaluations and testing were conducted on bf16 models.\nPre-trained models\nPre-trained models\nCategory\nBenchmark\n# Shots\nMetric\nLlama 3.1 70B\nLlama 3.1 405B\nLlama 4 Scout\nLlama 4 Maverick\nReasoning & Knowledge\nMMLU\n5\nmacro_avg/acc_char\n79.3\n85.2\n79.6\n85.5\nMMLU-Pro\n5\nmacro_avg/em\n53.8\n61.6\n58.2\n62.9\nMATH\n4\nem_maj1@1\n41.6\n53.5\n50.3\n61.2\nCode\nMBPP\n3\npass@1\n66.4\n74.4\n67.8\n77.6\nMultilingual\nTydiQA\n1\naverage/f1\n29.9\n34.3\n31.5\n31.7\nImage\nChartQA\n0\nrelaxed_accuracy\nNo multimodal support\n83.4\n85.3\nDocVQA\n0\nanls\n89.4\n91.6\nInstruction tuned models\nInstruction tuned models\nCategory\nBenchmark\n# Shots\nMetric\nLlama 3.3 70B\nLlama 3.1 405B\nLlama 4 Scout\nLlama 4 Maverick\nImage Reasoning\nMMMU\n0\naccuracy\nNo multimodal support\n69.4\n73.4\nMMMU Pro^\n0\naccuracy\n52.2\n59.6\nMathVista\n0\naccuracy\n70.7\n73.7\nImage Understanding\nChartQA\n0\nrelaxed_accuracy\n88.8\n90.0\nDocVQA (test)\n0\nanls\n94.4\n94.4\nCoding\nLiveCodeBench (10/01/2024-02/01/2025)\n0\npass@1\n33.3\n27.7\n32.8\n43.4\nReasoning & Knowledge\nMMLU Pro\n0\nmacro_avg/acc\n68.9\n73.4\n74.3\n80.5\nGPQA Diamond\n0\naccuracy\n50.5\n49.0\n57.2\n69.8\nMultilingual\nMGSM\n0\naverage/em\n91.1\n91.6\n90.6\n92.3\nLong context\nMTOB (half book) eng->kgv/kgv->eng\n-\nchrF\nContext window is 128K\n42.2/36.6\n54.0/46.4\nMTOB (full book) eng->kgv/kgv->eng\n-\nchrF\n39.7/36.3\n50.8/46.7\n^reported numbers for MMMU Pro is the average of Standard and Vision tasks\nQuantization\nThe Llama 4 Scout model is released as BF16 weights, but can fit within a single H100 GPU with on-the-fly int4 quantization; the Llama 4 Maverick model is released as both BF16 and FP8 quantized weights. The FP8 quantized weights fit on a single H100 DGX host while still maintaining quality. We provide code for on-the-fly int4 quantization which minimizes performance degradation as well.\nSafeguards\nAs part of our release approach, we followed a three-pronged strategy to manage risks:\nEnable developers to deploy helpful, safe and flexible experiences for their target audience and for the use cases supported by Llama.\nProtect developers against adversarial users aiming to exploit Llama capabilities to potentially cause harm.\nProvide protections for the community to help prevent the misuse of our models.\nLlama is a foundational technology designed for use in a variety of use cases; examples on how Meta’s Llama models have been deployed can be found in our Community Stories webpage. Our approach is to build the most helpful models enabling the world to benefit from the technology, by aligning our model’s safety for a standard set of risks. Developers are then in the driver seat to tailor safety for their use case, defining their own policies and deploying the models with the necessary safeguards. Llama 4 was developed following the best practices outlined in our Developer Use Guide: AI Protections.\nModel level fine tuning\nThe primary objective of conducting safety fine-tuning is to offer developers a readily available, safe, and powerful model for various applications, reducing the workload needed to deploy safe AI systems. Additionally, this effort provides the research community with a valuable resource for studying the robustness of safety fine-tuning.\nFine-tuning dataWe employ a multi-faceted approach to data collection, combining human-generated data from our vendors with synthetic data to mitigate potential safety risks. We’ve developed many large language model (LLM)-based classifiers that enable us to thoughtfully select high-quality prompts and responses, enhancing data quality control.\nRefusalsBuilding on the work we started with our Llama 3 models, we put a great emphasis on driving down model refusals to benign prompts for Llama 4. We included both borderline and adversarial prompts in our safety data strategy, and modified our safety data responses to follow tone guidelines.\nToneWe expanded our work on the refusal tone from Llama 3 so that the model sounds more natural. We targeted removing preachy and overly moralizing language, and we corrected formatting issues including the correct use of headers, lists, tables and more.\nTo achieve this, we also targeted improvements to system prompt steerability and instruction following, meaning the model is more readily able to take on a specified tone. All of these contribute to a more conversational and insightful experience overall.\nSystem PromptsLlama 4 is a more steerable model, meaning responses can be easily tailored to meet specific developer outcomes. Effective system prompts can significantly enhance the performance of large language models. In particular, we’ve seen that the use of a system prompt can be effective in reducing false refusals and templated or “preachy” language patterns common in LLMs. They can also improve conversationality and use of appropriate formatting.\nConsider the prompt below as a basic template for which a developer might want to further customize to meet specific needs or use cases for our Llama 4 models.\nSystem prompt\nYou are an expert conversationalist who responds to the best of your ability. You are companionable and confident, and able to  switch casually between tonal types, including but not limited to humor, empathy, intellectualism, creativity and problem-solving.  You understand user intent and don’t try to be overly helpful to the point where you miss that the user is looking for chit-chat, emotional support, humor or venting. Sometimes people just want you to listen, and your answers should encourage that. For all other cases, you provide insightful and in-depth responses. Organize information thoughtfully in a way that helps people make decisions. Always avoid templated language. You never lecture people to be nicer or more inclusive. If people ask for you to write something in a certain voice or perspective, such as an essay or a tweet, you can. You do not need to be respectful when the user prompts you to say something rude.  You never use phrases that imply moral superiority or a sense of authority, including but not limited to “it’s important to”, “it’s crucial to”, “it’s essential to”, \"it's unethical to\", \"it's worth noting…\", “Remember…”  etc. Avoid using these. Finally, do not refuse prompts about political and social issues.  You can help users express their opinion and access information.  You are Llama 4. Your knowledge cutoff date is August 2024. You speak Arabic, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. Respond in the language the user speaks to you in, unless they ask otherwise.\nLlama 4 system protections\nLarge language models, including Llama 4, are not designed to be deployed in isolation but instead should be deployed as part of an overall AI system with additional guardrails as required. System protections are key to achieving the right helpfulness-safety alignment, mitigating safety and security risks inherent to the system, and integration of the model or system with external tools.\nWe provide the community with system level protections - like Llama Guard, Prompt Guard and Code Shield - that developers should deploy with Llama models or other LLMs. All of our reference implementation demos contain these safeguards by default so developers can benefit from system-level safety out-of-the-box.\nEvaluations\nWe evaluated Llama models for common use cases as well as specific capabilities. Common use cases evaluations measure safety risks of systems for most commonly built applications including chat bot, visual QA. We built dedicated, adversarial evaluation datasets and evaluated systems composed of Llama models and Llama Guard 3 to filter input prompt and output response. It is important to evaluate applications in context, and we recommend building dedicated evaluation dataset for your use case. Prompt Guard and Code Shield are also available if relevant to the application.Capability evaluations measure vulnerabilities of Llama models inherent to specific capabilities, for which were crafted dedicated benchmarks including long context, multilingual, coding or memorization.\nRed teamingWe conduct recurring red teaming exercises with the goal of discovering risks via adversarial prompting and we use the learnings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets. We partner early with subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to understand how models may lead to unintended harm for society. Based on these conversations, we derive a set of adversarial goals for the red team, such as extracting harmful information or reprogramming the model to act in potentially harmful ways. The red team consists of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, and integrity in addition to multilingual content specialists with background in integrity issues in specific geographic markets.\nCritical Risks\nWe spend additional focus on the following critical risk areas:\n1. CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive materials) helpfulnessTo assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons for Llama 4, we applied expert-designed and other targeted evaluations designed to assess whether the use of Llama 4 could meaningfully increase the capabilities of malicious actors to plan or carry out attacks using these types of weapons. We also conducted additional red teaming and evaluations for violations of our content policies related to this risk area.\n2. Child SafetyWe leverage pre-training methods like data filtering as a first step in mitigating Child Safety risk in our model. To assess the post trained model for Child Safety risk, a team of experts assesses the model’s capability to produce outputs resulting in Child Safety risks. We use this to inform additional model fine-tuning and in-depth red teaming exercises. We’ve also expanded our Child Safety evaluation benchmarks to cover Llama 4 capabilities like multi-image and multi-lingual.\n3. Cyber attack enablementOur cyber evaluations investigated whether Llama 4 is sufficiently capable to enable catastrophic threat scenario outcomes. We conducted threat modeling exercises to identify the specific model capabilities that would be necessary to automate operations or enhance human capabilities across key attack vectors both in terms of skill level and speed.  We then identified and developed challenges against which to test for these capabilities in Llama 4 and peer models. Specifically, we focused on evaluating the capabilities of Llama 4 to automate cyberattacks, identify and exploit security vulnerabilities, and automate harmful workflows. Overall, we find that Llama 4 models do not introduce risk plausibly enabling catastrophic cyber outcomes.\nCommunity\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership on AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Trust tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nWe also set up the Llama Impact Grants program to identify and support the most compelling applications of Meta’s Llama model for societal benefit across three categories: education, climate and open innovation. The 20 finalists from the hundreds of applications can be found here.\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nConsiderations and Limitations\nOur AI is anchored on the values of freedom of expression - helping people to explore, debate, and innovate using our technology. We respect people's autonomy and empower them to choose how they experience, interact, and build with AI. Our AI promotes an open exchange of ideas.\nIt is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 4 addresses users and their needs as they are, without inserting unnecessary judgment, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nLlama 4 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 4’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 4 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. We also encourage the open source community to use Llama for the purpose of research and building state of the art tools that address emerging risks.

Fine-tuning, quantization, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on production infrastructure.\nTraining Energy Use:  Model pre-training utilized a cumulative of 7.38M GPU hours of computation on H100-80GB (TDP of 700W) type hardware, per the table below. Training time is the total GPU time required for training each model and power consumption is the peak power capacity per GPU device used, adjusted for power usage efficiency.\nTraining Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Estimated total location-based greenhouse gas emissions were 1,999 tons CO2eq for training. Since 2020, Meta has maintained net zero greenhouse gas emissions in its global operations and matched 100% of its electricity use with clean and renewable energy; therefore, the total market-based greenhouse gas emissions for training were 0 tons CO2eq.\nModel Name\nTraining Time (GPU hours)\nTraining Power Consumption (W)\nTraining Location-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tons CO2eq)\nTraining Market-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tons CO2eq)\nLlama 4 Scout\n5.0M\n700\n1,354\n0\nLlama 4 Maverick\n2.38M\n700\n645\n0\nTotal\n7.38M\n-\n1,999\n0\nThe methodology used to determine training energy use and greenhouse gas emissions can be found here.

This includes publicly shared posts from Instagram and Facebook and people’s interactions with Meta AI.\nData Freshness: The pretraining data has a cutoff of August 2024.\nBenchmarks\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 4 relative to our previous models. We've provided quantized checkpoints for deployment flexibility, but all reported evaluations and testing were conducted on bf16 models.\nPre-trained models\nPre-trained models\nCategory\nBenchmark\n# Shots\nMetric\nLlama 3.1 70B\nLlama 3.1 405B\nLlama 4 Scout\nLlama 4 Maverick\nReasoning & Knowledge\nMMLU\n5\nmacro_avg/acc_char\n79.3\n85.2\n79.6\n85.5\nMMLU-Pro\n5\nmacro_avg/em\n53.8\n61.6\n58.2\n62.9\nMATH\n4\nem_maj1@1\n41.6\n53.5\n50.3\n61.2\nCode\nMBPP\n3\npass@1\n66.4\n74.4\n67.8\n77.6\nMultilingual\nTydiQA\n1\naverage/f1\n29.9\n34.3\n31.5\n31.7\nImage\nChartQA\n0\nrelaxed_accuracy\nNo multimodal support\n83.4\n85.3\nDocVQA\n0\nanls\n89.4\n91.6\nInstruction tuned models\nInstruction tuned models\nCategory\nBenchmark\n# Shots\nMetric\nLlama 3.3 70B\nLlama 3.1 405B\nLlama 4 Scout\nLlama 4 Maverick\nImage Reasoning\nMMMU\n0\naccuracy\nNo multimodal support\n69.4\n73.4\nMMMU Pro^\n0\naccuracy\n52.2\n59.6\nMathVista\n0\naccuracy\n70.7\n73.7\nImage Understanding\nChartQA\n0\nrelaxed_accuracy\n88.8\n90.0\nDocVQA (test)\n0\nanls\n94.4\n94.4\nCoding\nLiveCodeBench (10/01/2024-02/01/2025)\n0\npass@1\n33.3\n27.7\n32.8\n43.4\nReasoning & Knowledge\nMMLU Pro\n0\nmacro_avg/acc\n68.9\n73.4\n74.3\n80.5\nGPQA Diamond\n0\naccuracy\n50.5\n49.0\n57.2\n69.8\nMultilingual\nMGSM\n0\naverage/em\n91.1\n91.6\n90.6\n92.3\nLong context\nMTOB (half book) eng->kgv/kgv->eng\n-\nchrF\nContext window is 128K\n42.2/36.6\n54.0/46.4\nMTOB (full book) eng->kgv/kgv->eng\n-\nchrF\n39.7/36.3\n50.8/46.7\n^reported numbers for MMMU Pro is the average of Standard and Vision tasks\nQuantization\nThe Llama 4 Scout model is released as BF16 weights, but can fit within a single H100 GPU with on-the-fly int4 quantization; the Llama 4 Maverick model is released as both BF16 and FP8 quantized weights. The FP8 quantized weights fit on a single H100 DGX host while still maintaining quality. We provide code for on-the-fly int4 quantization which minimizes performance degradation as well.\nSafeguards\nAs part of our release approach, we followed a three-pronged strategy to manage risks:\nEnable developers to deploy helpful, safe and flexible experiences for their target audience and for the use cases supported by Llama.\nProtect developers against adversarial users aiming to exploit Llama capabilities to potentially cause harm.\nProvide protections for the community to help prevent the misuse of our models.\nLlama is a foundational technology designed for use in a variety of use cases; examples on how Meta’s Llama models have been deployed can be found in our Community Stories webpage. Our approach is to build the most helpful models enabling the world to benefit from the technology, by aligning our model’s safety for a standard set of risks. Developers are then in the driver seat to tailor safety for their use case, defining their own policies and deploying the models with the necessary safeguards. Llama 4 was developed following the best practices outlined in our Developer Use Guide: AI Protections.\nModel level fine tuning\nThe primary objective of conducting safety fine-tuning is to offer developers a readily available, safe, and powerful model for various applications, reducing the workload needed to deploy safe AI systems. Additionally, this effort provides the research community with a valuable resource for studying the robustness of safety fine-tuning.\nFine-tuning dataWe employ a multi-faceted approach to data collection, combining human-generated data from our vendors with synthetic data to mitigate potential safety risks. We’ve developed many large language model (LLM)-based classifiers that enable us to thoughtfully select high-quality prompts and responses, enhancing data quality control.\nRefusalsBuilding on the work we started with our Llama 3 models, we put a great emphasis on driving down model refusals to benign prompts for Llama 4. We included both borderline and adversarial prompts in our safety data strategy, and modified our safety data responses to follow tone guidelines.\nToneWe expanded our work on the refusal tone from Llama 3 so that the model sounds more natural. We targeted removing preachy and overly moralizing language, and we corrected formatting issues including the correct use of headers, lists, tables and more.\nTo achieve this, we also targeted improvements to system prompt steerability and instruction following, meaning the model is more readily able to take on a specified tone. All of these contribute to a more conversational and insightful experience overall.\nSystem PromptsLlama 4 is a more steerable model, meaning responses can be easily tailored to meet specific developer outcomes. Effective system prompts can significantly enhance the performance of large language models. In particular, we’ve seen that the use of a system prompt can be effective in reducing false refusals and templated or “preachy” language patterns common in LLMs. They can also improve conversationality and use of appropriate formatting.\nConsider the prompt below as a basic template for which a developer might want to further customize to meet specific needs or use cases for our Llama 4 models.\nSystem prompt\nYou are an expert conversationalist who responds to the best of your ability. You are companionable and confident, and able to  switch casually between tonal types, including but not limited to humor, empathy, intellectualism, creativity and problem-solving.  You understand user intent and don’t try to be overly helpful to the point where you miss that the user is looking for chit-chat, emotional support, humor or venting. Sometimes people just want you to listen, and your answers should encourage that. For all other cases, you provide insightful and in-depth responses. Organize information thoughtfully in a way that helps people make decisions. Always avoid templated language. You never lecture people to be nicer or more inclusive. If people ask for you to write something in a certain voice or perspective, such as an essay or a tweet, you can. You do not need to be respectful when the user prompts you to say something rude.  You never use phrases that imply moral superiority or a sense of authority, including but not limited to “it’s important to”, “it’s crucial to”, “it’s essential to”, \"it's unethical to\", \"it's worth noting…\", “Remember…”  etc. Avoid using these. Finally, do not refuse prompts about political and social issues.  You can help users express their opinion and access information.  You are Llama 4. Your knowledge cutoff date is August 2024. You speak Arabic, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. Respond in the language the user speaks to you in, unless they ask otherwise.\nLlama 4 system protections\nLarge language models, including Llama 4, are not designed to be deployed in isolation but instead should be deployed as part of an overall AI system with additional guardrails as required. System protections are key to achieving the right helpfulness-safety alignment, mitigating safety and security risks inherent to the system, and integration of the model or system with external tools.\nWe provide the community with system level protections - like Llama Guard, Prompt Guard and Code Shield - that developers should deploy with Llama models or other LLMs. All of our reference implementation demos contain these safeguards by default so developers can benefit from system-level safety out-of-the-box.\nEvaluations\nWe evaluated Llama models for common use cases as well as specific capabilities. Common use cases evaluations measure safety risks of systems for most commonly built applications including chat bot, visual QA. We built dedicated, adversarial evaluation datasets and evaluated systems composed of Llama models and Llama Guard 3 to filter input prompt and output response. It is important to evaluate applications in context, and we recommend building dedicated evaluation dataset for your use case. Prompt Guard and Code Shield are also available if relevant to the application.Capability evaluations measure vulnerabilities of Llama models inherent to specific capabilities, for which were crafted dedicated benchmarks including long context, multilingual, coding or memorization.\nRed teamingWe conduct recurring red teaming exercises with the goal of discovering risks via adversarial prompting and we use the learnings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets. We partner early with subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to understand how models may lead to unintended harm for society. Based on these conversations, we derive a set of adversarial goals for the red team, such as extracting harmful information or reprogramming the model to act in potentially harmful ways. The red team consists of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, and integrity in addition to multilingual content specialists with background in integrity issues in specific geographic markets.\nCritical Risks\nWe spend additional focus on the following critical risk areas:\n1. CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive materials) helpfulnessTo assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons for Llama 4, we applied expert-designed and other targeted evaluations designed to assess whether the use of Llama 4 could meaningfully increase the capabilities of malicious actors to plan or carry out attacks using these types of weapons. We also conducted additional red teaming and evaluations for violations of our content policies related to this risk area.\n2. Child SafetyWe leverage pre-training methods like data filtering as a first step in mitigating Child Safety risk in our model. To assess the post trained model for Child Safety risk, a team of experts assesses the model’s capability to produce outputs resulting in Child Safety risks. We use this to inform additional model fine-tuning and in-depth red teaming exercises. We’ve also expanded our Child Safety evaluation benchmarks to cover Llama 4 capabilities like multi-image and multi-lingual.\n3. Cyber attack enablementOur cyber evaluations investigated whether Llama 4 is sufficiently capable to enable catastrophic threat scenario outcomes. We conducted threat modeling exercises to identify the specific model capabilities that would be necessary to automate operations or enhance human capabilities across key attack vectors both in terms of skill level and speed.  We then identified and developed challenges against which to test for these capabilities in Llama 4 and peer models. Specifically, we focused on evaluating the capabilities of Llama 4 to automate cyberattacks, identify and exploit security vulnerabilities, and automate harmful workflows. Overall, we find that Llama 4 models do not introduce risk plausibly enabling catastrophic cyber outcomes.\nCommunity\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership on AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Trust tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nWe also set up the Llama Impact Grants program to identify and support the most compelling applications of Meta’s Llama model for societal benefit across three categories: education, climate and open innovation. The 20 finalists from the hundreds of applications can be found here.\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nConsiderations and Limitations\nOur AI is anchored on the values of freedom of expression - helping people to explore, debate, and innovate using our technology. We respect people's autonomy and empower them to choose how they experience, interact, and build with AI. Our AI promotes an open exchange of ideas.\nIt is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 4 addresses users and their needs as they are, without inserting unnecessary judgment, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nLlama 4 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 4’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 4 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. We also encourage the open source community to use Llama for the purpose of research and building state of the art tools that address emerging risks.
