It can serve as the building block for various applications or research that are related to world generation. This model is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.\nModel Developer: NVIDIA\nModel Versions\nThe Cosmos-Transfer2.5 diffusion-based model family includes the following models:\nCosmos-Transfer2.5-2B\nGiven a text prompt and one or multiple (up to four) control input videos -- Canny edge, blurred RGB, segmentation mask, and depth map  -- predict a photorealistic output video by leveraging guidance in the control input videos.

The cross-attention layers allow the model to condition on input text throughout the denoising process. Before each layer, adaptive layer normalization is applied to embed the time information for denoising. When image or video is provided as input, their latent frames are concatenated with the generated frames along the temporal dimension. Augment noise is added to conditional latent frames to bridge the training and inference gap.\nThe control branch is formed by replicating a few transformer blocks of the base model. It processes the control input video to extract control signals, which are then injected into the corresponding transformer blocks of the base model, guiding the denoising process with structured control. When multiple control input videos are provided, each is processed by a dedicated control branch to extract modality-specific control signals. These control signals are then combined with spatial-temporal weight maps, and injected into the corresponding transformer blocks in the base model.\nThis model was developed based on: Cosmos-Predict2.5\nNumber of model parameters: 2,358,047,744\nInput/Output Specifications\nInput\nInput Type(s):  Text+Video\nInput Format(s):\nText: String\nControl Input Video: mp4\nInput Parameters:\nText: One-dimensional (1D)\nControl Input Video: Three-dimensional (3D)\nOther Properties Related to Input:\nThe input text string should contain fewer than 300 words and should provide descriptive content for world generation, such as a scene description, key objects or characters, background, and any specific actions or motions to be depicted within the 5-second duration.\nThe model supports control input videos of varying lengths, but a length which is multiples of 93 frames (e.g., 93, 186, or 279 frames) performs the best.\nThe model supports four types of control input videos: blurred video, Canny edge video, depth map video, and segmentation mask video. When multiple control inputs are provided, they must be derived from the same source video, representing different modalities of the same content while maintaining identical spatio-temporal dimensions.\nThe control input video should have a spatial resolution of 1280×720 for the 720P model.\nOutput\nOutput Type(s): Video\nOutput Format(s): mp4\nOutput Parameters: Three-dimensional (3D)\nOther Properties Related to Output: The output video is of the same temporal length and spatial resolution of the control input video. The frame rate of the output video is determined by the model variant (i.e., 16 FPS)\nThe video content visualizes the input text description as a short animated scene, capturing key elements within the specified time constraints.\nOur AI models are designed and/or optimized to run on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems. By leveraging NVIDIA's hardware (e.g. GPU cores) and software frameworks (e.g., CUDA libraries), the model achieves faster training and inference times compared to CPU-only solutions.\nSoftware Integration\nRuntime Engine(s):\nCosmos-Transfer2.5\nSupported Hardware Microarchitecture Compatibility:\nNVIDIA Ampere\nNVIDIA Blackwell\nNVIDIA Hopper\nNote: Only BF16 precision is tested.

Other precisions like FP16 or FP32 are not officially supported.\nUsage\nSee Cosmos-Transfer2.5 for details.\nLimitations\nDespite various improvements in world generation for Physical AI, Cosmos-Transfer2.5 models still face technical and application limitations for world-to-world generation. In particular, they struggle to generate long, high-resolution videos without artifacts. Common issues include temporal inconsistency, camera and object motion instability, and imprecise interactions. The models may inaccurately represent 3D space, 4D space-time, or physical laws in the generated videos, leading to artifacts such as disappearing or morphing objects, unrealistic interactions, and implausible motions. As a result, applying these models for applications that require simulating physical law-grounded environments or complex multi-agent dynamics remains challenging.\nInference:\nAcceleration Engine: PyTorch, Transformer Engine\nTest Hardware: H100, A100, GB200\nEthical Considerations\nNVIDIA believes Trustworthy AI is a shared responsibility and we have established policies and practices to enable development for a wide array of AI applications.

With Wan2.2, we have focused on incorporating the following innovations:\n👍 Effective MoE Architecture: Wan2.2 introduces a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture into video diffusion models. By separating the denoising process cross timesteps with specialized powerful expert models, this enlarges the overall model capacity while maintaining the same computational cost.\n👍 Cinematic-level Aesthetics: Wan2.2 incorporates meticulously curated aesthetic data, complete with detailed labels for lighting, composition, contrast, color tone, and more. This allows for more precise and controllable cinematic style generation, facilitating the creation of videos with customizable aesthetic preferences.\n👍 Complex Motion Generation: Compared to Wan2.1, Wan2.2 is trained on a significantly larger data, with +65.6% more images and +83.2% more videos. This expansion notably enhances the model's generalization across multiple dimensions such as motions,  semantics, and aesthetics, achieving TOP performance among all open-sourced and closed-sourced models.\n👍 Efficient High-Definition Hybrid TI2V:  Wan2.2 open-sources a 5B model built with our advanced Wan2.2-VAE that achieves a compression ratio of 16×16×4. This model supports both text-to-video and image-to-video generation at 720P resolution with 24fps and can also run on consumer-grade graphics cards like 4090. It is one of the fastest 720P@24fps models currently available, capable of serving both the industrial and academic sectors simultaneously.\nThis repository contains our T2V-A14B model, which supports generating 5s videos at both 480P and 720P resolutions. Built with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, it delivers outstanding video generation quality. On our new benchmark Wan-Bench 2.0, the model surpasses leading commercial models across most key evaluation dimensions.\nVideo Demos\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n🔥 Latest News!!\nJul 28, 2025: 👋 We've released the inference code and model weights of Wan2.2.\nCommunity Works\nIf your research or project builds upon Wan2.1 or Wan2.2, we welcome you to share it with us so we can highlight it for the broader community.\n📑 Todo List\nWan2.2 Text-to-Video\nMulti-GPU Inference code of the A14B and 14B models\nCheckpoints of the A14B and 14B models\nComfyUI integration\nDiffusers integration\nWan2.2 Image-to-Video\nMulti-GPU Inference code of the A14B model\nCheckpoints of the A14B model\nComfyUI integration\nDiffusers integration\nWan2.2 Text-Image-to-Video\nMulti-GPU Inference code of the 5B model\nCheckpoints of the 5B model\nComfyUI integration\nDiffusers integration\nRun Wan2.2\nInstallation\nClone the repo:\ngit clone https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.2.git\ncd Wan2.2\nInstall dependencies:\n# Ensure torch >= 2.4.0\npip install -r requirements.txt\nModel Download\nModels\nDownload Links\nDescription\nT2V-A14B\n🤗 Huggingface    🤖 ModelScope\nText-to-Video MoE model, supports 480P & 720P\nI2V-A14B\n🤗 Huggingface    🤖 ModelScope\nImage-to-Video MoE model, supports 480P & 720P\nTI2V-5B\n🤗 Huggingface     🤖 ModelScope\nHigh-compression VAE, T2V+I2V, supports 720P\n💡Note:\nThe TI2V-5B model supports 720P video generation at 24 FPS.\nDownload models using huggingface-cli:\npip install \"huggingface_hub[cli]\"\nhuggingface-cli download Wan-AI/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --local-dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B\nDownload models using modelscope-cli:\npip install modelscope\nmodelscope download Wan-AI/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --local_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B\nRun Text-to-Video Generation\nThis repository supports the Wan2.2-T2V-A14B Text-to-Video model and can simultaneously support video generation at 480P and 720P resolutions.\n(1) Without Prompt Extension\nTo facilitate implementation, we will start with a basic version of the inference process that skips the prompt extension step.\nSingle-GPU inference\npython generate.py  --task t2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --prompt \"Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage.\"\n💡 This command can run on a GPU with at least 80GB VRAM.\n💡If you encounter OOM (Out-of-Memory) issues, you can use the --offload_model True, --convert_model_dtype and --t5_cpu options to reduce GPU memory usage.\nMulti-GPU inference using FSDP + DeepSpeed Ulysses\nWe use PyTorch FSDP and DeepSpeed Ulysses to accelerate inference.\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task t2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --prompt \"Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage.\"\n(2) Using Prompt Extension\nExtending the prompts can effectively enrich the details in the generated videos, further enhancing the video quality. Therefore, we recommend enabling prompt extension. We provide the following two methods for prompt extension:\nUse the Dashscope API for extension.\nApply for a dashscope.api_key in advance (EN | CN).\nConfigure the environment variable DASH_API_KEY to specify the Dashscope API key. For users of Alibaba Cloud's international site, you also need to set the environment variable DASH_API_URL to 'https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/api/v1'. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the dashscope document.\nUse the qwen-plus model for text-to-video tasks and qwen-vl-max for image-to-video tasks.\nYou can modify the model used for extension with the parameter --prompt_extend_model. For example:\nDASH_API_KEY=your_key torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py  --task t2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --prompt \"Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage\" --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_method 'dashscope' --prompt_extend_target_lang 'zh'\nUsing a local model for extension.\nBy default, the Qwen model on HuggingFace is used for this extension. Users can choose Qwen models or other models based on the available GPU memory size.\nFor text-to-video tasks, you can use models like Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct.\nFor image-to-video tasks, you can use models like Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct.\nLarger models generally provide better extension results but require more GPU memory.\nYou can modify the model used for extension with the parameter --prompt_extend_model , allowing you to specify either a local model path or a Hugging Face model. For example:\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py  --task t2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --prompt \"Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage\" --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_method 'local_qwen' --prompt_extend_target_lang 'zh'\nComputational Efficiency on Different GPUs\nWe test the computational efficiency of different Wan2.2 models on different GPUs in the following table. The results are presented in the format: Total time (s) / peak GPU memory (GB).\nThe parameter settings for the tests presented in this table are as follows:\n(1) Multi-GPU: 14B: --ulysses_size 4/8 --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp, 5B: --ulysses_size 4/8 --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --t5_cpu; Single-GPU: 14B: --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype, 5B: --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --t5_cpu\n(--convert_model_dtype converts model parameter types to config.param_dtype);\n(2) The distributed testing utilizes the built-in FSDP and Ulysses implementations, with FlashAttention3 deployed on Hopper architecture GPUs;\n(3) Tests were run without the --use_prompt_extend flag;\n(4) Reported results are the average of multiple samples taken after the warm-up phase.\nIntroduction of Wan2.2\nWan2.2 builds on the foundation of Wan2.1 with notable improvements in generation quality and model capability. This upgrade is driven by a series of key technical innovations, mainly including the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, upgraded training data, and high-compression video generation.\n(1) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture\nWan2.2 introduces Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture into the video generation diffusion model. MoE has been widely validated in large language models as an efficient approach to increase total model parameters while keeping inference cost nearly unchanged. In Wan2.2, the A14B model series adopts a two-expert design tailored to the denoising process of diffusion models: a high-noise expert for the early stages, focusing on overall layout; and a low-noise expert for the later stages, refining video details. Each expert model has about 14B parameters, resulting in a total of 27B parameters but only 14B active parameters per step, keeping inference computation and GPU memory nearly unchanged.\nThe transition point between the two experts is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a metric that decreases monotonically as the denoising step $t$ increases. At the beginning of the denoising process, $t$ is large and the noise level is high, so the SNR is at its minimum, denoted as ${SNR}{min}$. In this stage, the high-noise expert is activated. We define a threshold step ${t}{moe}$ corresponding to half of the ${SNR}{min}$, and switch to the low-noise expert when $t<{t}{moe}$.\nTo validate the effectiveness of the MoE architecture, four settings are compared based on their validation loss curves. The baseline Wan2.1 model does not employ the MoE architecture. Among the MoE-based variants, the Wan2.1 & High-Noise Expert reuses the Wan2.1 model as the low-noise expert while uses the  Wan2.2's high-noise expert, while the Wan2.1 & Low-Noise Expert uses Wan2.1 as the high-noise expert and employ the Wan2.2's low-noise expert. The Wan2.2 (MoE) (our final version) achieves the lowest validation loss, indicating that its generated video distribution is closest to ground-truth and exhibits superior convergence.\n(2) Efficient High-Definition Hybrid TI2V\nTo enable more efficient deployment, Wan2.2 also explores a high-compression design. In addition to the 27B MoE models, a 5B dense model, i.e., TI2V-5B, is released. It is supported by a high-compression Wan2.2-VAE, which achieves a $T\\times H\\times W$ compression ratio of $4\\times16\\times16$, increasing the overall compression rate to 64 while maintaining high-quality video reconstruction. With an additional patchification layer, the total compression ratio of TI2V-5B reaches $4\\times32\\times32$. Without specific optimization, TI2V-5B can generate a 5-second 720P video in under 9 minutes on a single consumer-grade GPU, ranking among the fastest 720P@24fps video generation models. This model also natively supports both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks within a single unified framework, covering both academic research and practical applications.\nComparisons to SOTAs\nWe compared Wan2.2 with leading closed-source commercial models on our new Wan-Bench 2.0, evaluating performance across multiple crucial dimensions.

For all other tasks, we set the output length to 32,768.\nQuickstart\nThe code of Qwen3-MoE has been in the latest Hugging Face transformers and we advise you to use the latest version of transformers.\nWith transformers<4.51.0, you will encounter the following error:\nKeyError: 'qwen3_moe'\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507\"\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_name,\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = \"Give me a short introduction to large language model.\"\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n**model_inputs,\nmax_new_tokens=32768\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\n# parsing thinking content\ntry:\n# rindex finding 151668 (</think>)\nindex = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)\nexcept ValueError:\nindex = 0\nthinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True).strip(\"\\n\")\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip(\"\\n\")\nprint(\"thinking content:\", thinking_content) # no opening <think> tag\nprint(\"content:\", content)\nFor deployment, you can use sglang>=0.4.6.post1 or vllm>=0.8.5 or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:\nSGLang:python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 --tp 8 --context-length 262144  --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1\nvLLM:vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 --tensor-parallel-size 8 --max-model-len 262144 --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1\nNote: If you encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues, you may consider reducing the context length to a smaller value. However, since the model may require longer token sequences for reasoning, we strongly recommend using a context length greater than 131,072 when possible.\nFor local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.\nAgentic Use\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using Qwen-Agent to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n# Define LLM\n# Using Alibaba Cloud Model Studio\nllm_cfg = {\n'model': 'qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507',\n'model_type': 'qwen_dashscope',\n}\n# Using OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. It is recommended to disable the reasoning and the tool call parsing\n# functionality of the deployment frameworks and let Qwen-Agent automate the related operations.

On sequences approaching 1M tokens, the system achieves up to a 3× speedup compared to standard attention implementations.\nFor full technical details, see the Qwen2.5-1M Technical Report.\nHow to Enable 1M Token Context\nTo effectively process a 1 million token context, users will require approximately 1000 GB of total GPU memory. This accounts for model weights, KV-cache storage, and peak activation memory demands.\nStep 1: Update Configuration File\nDownload the model and replace the content of your config.json with config_1m.json, which includes the config for length extrapolation and sparse attention.\nexport MODELNAME=Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507\nhuggingface-cli download Qwen/${MODELNAME} --local-dir ${MODELNAME}\nmv ${MODELNAME}/config.json ${MODELNAME}/config.json.bak\nmv ${MODELNAME}/config_1m.json ${MODELNAME}/config.json\nStep 2: Launch Model Server\nAfter updating the config, proceed with either vLLM or SGLang for serving the model.\nOption 1: Using vLLM\nTo run Qwen with 1M context support:\npip install -U vllm \\\n--torch-backend=auto \\\n--extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly\nThen launch the server with Dual Chunk Flash Attention enabled:\nVLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=DUAL_CHUNK_FLASH_ATTN VLLM_USE_V1=0 \\\nvllm serve ./Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 \\\n--tensor-parallel-size 8 \\\n--max-model-len 1010000 \\\n--enable-chunked-prefill \\\n--max-num-batched-tokens 131072 \\\n--enforce-eager \\\n--max-num-seqs 1 \\\n--gpu-memory-utilization 0.85 \\\n--enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1\nKey Parameters\nParameter\nPurpose\nVLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=DUAL_CHUNK_FLASH_ATTN\nEnables the custom attention kernel for long-context efficiency\n--max-model-len 1010000\nSets maximum context length to ~1M tokens\n--enable-chunked-prefill\nAllows chunked prefill for very long inputs (avoids OOM)\n--max-num-batched-tokens 131072\nControls batch size during prefill; balances throughput and memory\n--enforce-eager\nDisables CUDA graph capture (required for dual chunk attention)\n--max-num-seqs 1\nLimits concurrent sequences due to extreme memory usage\n--gpu-memory-utilization 0.85\nSet the fraction of GPU memory to be used for the model executor\nOption 2: Using SGLang\nFirst, clone and install the specialized branch:\ngit clone https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang.git\ncd sglang\npip install -e \"python[all]\"\nLaunch the server with DCA support:\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server \\\n--model-path ./Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 \\\n--context-length 1010000 \\\n--mem-frac 0.75 \\\n--attention-backend dual_chunk_flash_attn \\\n--tp 8 \\\n--chunked-prefill-size 131072 \\\n--reasoning-parser deepseek-r1\nKey Parameters\nParameter\nPurpose\n--attention-backend dual_chunk_flash_attn\nActivates Dual Chunk Flash Attention\n--context-length 1010000\nDefines max input length\n--mem-frac 0.75\nThe fraction of the memory used for static allocation (model weights and KV cache memory pool). Use a smaller value if you see out-of-memory errors.\n--tp 8\nTensor parallelism size (matches model sharding)\n--chunked-prefill-size 131072\nPrefill chunk size for handling long inputs without OOM\nTroubleshooting:\nEncountering the error: \"The model's max sequence length (xxxxx) is larger than the maximum number of tokens that can be stored in the KV cache.\" or \"RuntimeError: Not enough memory. Please try to increase --mem-fraction-static.\"\nThe VRAM reserved for the KV cache is insufficient.\nvLLM: Consider reducing the max_model_len or increasing the tensor_parallel_size and gpu_memory_utilization. Alternatively, you can reduce max_num_batched_tokens, although this may significantly slow down inference.\nSGLang: Consider reducing the context-length or increasing the tp and mem-frac. Alternatively, you can reduce chunked-prefill-size, although this may significantly slow down inference.\nEncountering the error: \"torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory.\"\nThe VRAM reserved for activation weights is insufficient. You can try lowering gpu_memory_utilization or mem-frac, but be aware that this might reduce the VRAM available for the KV cache.\nEncountering the error: \"Input prompt (xxxxx tokens) + lookahead slots (0) is too long and exceeds the capacity of the block manager.\" or \"The input (xxx xtokens) is longer than the model's context length (xxx tokens).\"\nThe input is too lengthy. Consider using a shorter sequence or increasing the max_model_len or context-length.\nLong-Context Performance\nWe test the model on an 1M version of the RULER benchmark.\nModel Name\nAcc avg\n4k\n8k\n16k\n32k\n64k\n96k\n128k\n192k\n256k\n384k\n512k\n640k\n768k\n896k\n1000k\nQwen3-235B-A22B (Thinking)\n82.9\n97.3\n95.9\n95.3\n88.7\n91.7\n91.5\n87.9\n85.4\n78.4\n75.6\n73.7\n73.6\n70.6\n69.9\n67.6\nQwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 (Full Attention)\n95.4\n99.6\n100.0\n99.5\n99.6\n99.1\n100.0\n98.8\n98.1\n96.1\n95.2\n90.0\n91.7\n89.7\n87.9\n85.9\nQwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 (Sparse Attention)\n95.5\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n98.6\n99.5\n98.8\n98.1\n95.4\n93.0\n90.7\n91.9\n91.7\n87.8\n86.6\nAll models are evaluated with Dual Chunk Attention enabled.\nSince the evaluation is time-consuming, we use 260 samples for each length (13 sub-tasks, 20 samples for each).\nTo avoid overly verbose reasoning, we set the thinking budget to 8,192 tokens.\nBest Practices\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\nSampling Parameters:\nWe suggest using Temperature=0.6, TopP=0.95, TopK=20, and MinP=0.\nFor supported frameworks, you can adjust the presence_penalty parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\nAdequate Output Length: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 81,920 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\nStandardize Output Format: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\nMath Problems: Include \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" in the prompt.\nMultiple-Choice Questions: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: \"Please show your choice in the answer field with only the choice letter, e.g., \"answer\": \"C\".\"\nNo Thinking Content in History: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\ntitle={Qwen3 Technical Report},\nauthor={Qwen Team},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2505.09388},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.CL},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388},\n}",

Meanwhile, specifying enable_thinking=False is no longer required.\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our blog, GitHub, and Documentation.\nQuickstart\nWe advise you to use the latest version of transformers.\nWith transformers<4.51.0, you will encounter the following error:\nKeyError: 'qwen3_moe'\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-FP8\"\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_name,\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = \"Write a quick sort algorithm.\"\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n**model_inputs,\nmax_new_tokens=65536\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(\"content:\", content)\nNote: If you encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues, consider reducing the context length to a shorter value, such as 32,768.\nNote on FP8\nFor convenience and performance, we have provided fp8-quantized model checkpoint for Qwen3, whose name ends with -FP8. The quantization method is fine-grained fp8 quantization with block size of 128. You can find more details in the quantization_config field in config.json.\nYou can use the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-FP8 model with serveral inference frameworks, including transformers, sglang, and vllm, as the original bfloat16 model.\nHowever, please pay attention to the following known issues:\ntransformers:\nthere are currently issues with the \"fine-grained fp8\" method in transformers for distributed inference. You may need to set the environment variable CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1 if multiple devices are used in inference.\nAgentic Coding\nQwen3-Coder excels in tool calling capabilities.\nYou can simply define or use any tools as following example.\n# Your tool implementation\ndef square_the_number(num: float) -> dict:\nreturn num ** 2\n# Define Tools\ntools=[\n{\n\"type\":\"function\",\n\"function\":{\n\"name\": \"square_the_number\",\n\"description\": \"output the square of the number.\",\n\"parameters\": {\n\"type\": \"object\",\n\"required\": [\"input_num\"],\n\"properties\": {\n'input_num': {\n'type': 'number',\n'description': 'input_num is a number that will be squared'\n}\n},\n}\n}\n}\n]\nimport OpenAI\n# Define LLM\nclient = OpenAI(\n# Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API\nbase_url='http://localhost:8000/v1',  # api_base\napi_key=\"EMPTY\"\n)\nmessages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'square the number 1024'}]\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create(\nmessages=messages,\nmodel=\"Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-FP8\",\nmax_tokens=65536,\ntools=tools,\n)\nprint(completion.choice[0])\nBest Practices\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\nSampling Parameters:\nWe suggest using temperature=0.7, top_p=0.8, top_k=20, repetition_penalty=1.05.\nAdequate Output Length: We recommend using an output length of 65,536 tokens for most queries, which is adequate for instruct models.\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\ntitle={Qwen3 Technical Report},\nauthor={Qwen Team},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2505.09388},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.CL},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388},\n}",

Write fluidly.\nProceed.\n[[[ end thinking ]]]\nThe skyscraper sways, as I watch the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode into a spray of glittering glass and fire‑rain. The world outside shatters into a kaleidoscope of neon, steel, and smoke, and for an instant my heart stops—then it thunders like a freight train against my ribs.\nI’m perched in the corner office of Apex Dynamics, the city’s most coveted address, where the view is supposed to be a prize. Instead, it has become a theater of terror. The glass pane that used to frame the river below now hangs in jagged shards, trembling as if still clinging to some invisible rope. Below me, the streetlights flicker like dying fireflies, their amber glow swallowed by a black plume that curls upward, choking the sky.\nThe building groans, a low, resonant moan that vibrates through my bones and rattles the cheap plastic of the desk lamp beside me. I can feel it in my fingertips—the tremor traveling up my arms, down to my nails, where they dig into the worn leather chair. The whole structure seems to be holding its breath, waiting for something else to break.\n“Diana!” a voice shouts from the hallway, sharp and panicked. It belongs to Marco, our senior analyst, his face half‑shadowed by the doorway, eyes wide with that mixture of disbelief and adrenaline you only see when someone watches their own life being ripped apart on a screen. He’s already sprinting toward the emergency stairs, his shoes thudding against the polished marble like war drums.\nI can’t move. My legs are rooted to the spot as if the floor itself has turned into quicksand. The explosion behind that window sent a shockwave through the building, and I’m still trying to process how something so sudden could feel inevitable. My mind flickers between the present—flames licking the side of the tower, smoke curling like serpents—and the memory of the morning briefing when we were all laughing over coffee, talking about quarterly projections as if the world outside our glass walls didn’t exist.\nThe fire alarm blares now, a shrill, metallic scream that seems to cut through the roar of the wind. It’s an old system—one that never quite worked right until today, when it finally decided to do its job. The sound is both a warning and a call to action, but I’m caught in a strange limbo where everything feels simultaneously too slow and too fast.\nA gust of hot air slams into the open breach, carrying with it the smell of ozone, burnt plastic, and something metallic that makes my stomach turn. It whips through the office, scattering papers like startled birds. My own report—pages of market analysis, graphs, projections—flies up in a chaotic dance, landing on the floor in a crumpled heap. I stare at them, half‑expecting the numbers to rearrange themselves into some kind of prophecy.\n“Diana! Get down!” Marco’s voice cuts through my reverie again, now louder, more urgent. He’s almost at the door, his hand outstretched as if he could grab me from across the room. My breath catches in my throat; I feel the air in my lungs thin, each inhalation a little gasp for oxygen that seems to have been stolen by the fire.\nI know what I should do. The emergency plan is etched into every employee’s mind: stay low, find an exit, don’t use elevators. Yet there’s something else—a part of me that has spent years building this empire of glass and steel, a part that feels a fierce ownership over these floors, over the view that now threatens to become a graveyard.\nThe building shudders again, more violently this time, as if an unseen hand is shaking it. The lights flicker, then die, plunging me into a dim, amber glow from the emergency bulbs that line the corridors like ghostly sentinels. In the darkness, I can see the outlines of other desks, the silhouettes of coworkers who have either fled or frozen where they stand.\nI glance at the window once more. The explosion has carved a jagged mouth in the side of the tower; beyond it, the city sprawls in a surreal tableau—cars like tiny ants, skyscrapers reduced to silhouettes against an orange sky. A distant siren wails, its sound distorted by the wind, and somewhere far below, a child’s cry pierces the air, a reminder that life continues even when the world you know collapses.\nMy hand finally moves, trembling as it reaches for the metal railing of my desk. The cold steel feels like a lifeline. I pull myself up, knees buckling, and stumble toward Marco, who is already halfway to the stairwell. He grabs me by the elbow, his grip surprisingly firm despite the tremor in his own shoulders.\n“Come on,” he says, his voice hoarse but determined. “The stairs are clear. We’ve got to—”\nA deafening crack erupts from somewhere above us, a sound that seems to split the building in two. The ceiling tiles above my head shake loose and rain down like a torrent of grey snow. One lands on Marco’s shoulder with a soft thud, another smacks against my cheek, sending a spray of dust into my eyes. I cough, choking on the acrid taste of ash that now coats my tongue.\nThe stairwell door is half‑open, a gaping maw leading down into darkness. The emergency lights cast long shadows on the concrete walls, turning every step into an uncertain gamble. Marco pushes me forward, his hand still gripping my arm as if I were a child who might otherwise run back to the broken window and stare at the world burning away.\nWe descend, each footfall echoing in the hollow shaft like a drumbeat for some ancient rite. The air grows cooler, the smell of smoke receding slightly as we move further from the fire’s source. Yet every now and then a gust of hot wind rushes past us, carrying with it a faint hiss that makes my skin crawl.\nI try to focus on the rhythm of our steps, the repetitive thump‑thump of boots against metal grates, but my mind keeps spiraling back to the view. The city—our city—has always been a tapestry of light and shadow, of ambition and desperation. Now it’s a canvas smeared with orange and black, a reminder that the structures we build are as fragile as the glass that once framed our dreams.\nMarco stops suddenly at a landing, turning his head to look back up the stairwell. His eyes meet mine, wide and haunted. “The fire alarm is still on,” he whispers, almost to himself. “We need to get out before it collapses.”\nI nod, though my throat feels raw. My heart pounds in my ears, a frantic drum that seems louder than any siren. I can hear the distant rumble of something massive shifting—perhaps another floor giving way, perhaps the building itself groaning under its own weight.\nThe stairwell continues to descend into an abyss of uncertainty. Above us, the skyscraper sways like a ship caught in a storm, each movement sending tremors through the concrete veins that support it. I think about my office, the window that once offered a panoramic view of success, now reduced to broken shards and memory.\nWe reach the emergency exit—a heavy steel door bolted shut with a massive red lever. Marco pulls at it with all his strength; the metal groans, straining against its own weight. For a moment I think we’ll never get through, that the building will swallow us whole. Then the latch gives, and the door swings open onto an alleyway bathed in the flickering light of emergency floodlamps.\nThe night air hits me like a slap, cold and sharp, carrying with it the scent of rain on concrete. I inhale deeply, feeling the coolness fill my lungs, pushing out the lingering acrid smoke that clings to my throat. Below us, the street is chaos—people running, sirens wailing, flames licking the sides of other buildings.\nMarco looks back once more at the tower, his silhouette framed by the orange glow of fire. “We made it,” he says, his voice hoarse but relieved. I can see the tears in his eyes, reflecting the dancing flames that still rage above us.\nI turn away, my gaze falling on a small, cracked billboard advertising some luxury condominium—an image of sleek glass towers and smiling families. The billboard’s lights flicker, then go out, plunging its advertisement into darkness. It feels symbolic: the promise of progress, now reduced to ash.\nMy mind is a whirlwind of images—the exploding window, the shattered glass raining down like crystal rain; the tremor of the building as it sways, each movement a reminder that even the strongest structures can crumble; the frantic rush down stairwells, the cold grip of steel rails, the distant cries and sirens. All these sensations swirl together, forming a tapestry of terror and survival.\nI look at my own hands—still trembling, still shaking from adrenaline—and realize they’re covered in soot, tiny specks of black that cling to every crease, every nail. I brush them off on the side of the alley wall, watching the dust puff away like ghostly snowflakes in the night wind.\n“Diana,” Marco says again, softer now, “Are you okay?”\nI manage a weak smile, though my thoughts are still tangled with images of fire and broken glass. “I think so,” I reply, my voice hoarse. “Just… just need to get home.”\nHe nods, his eyes scanning the street for any sign of rescue vehicles. In the distance, a firetruck roars toward us, its lights flashing, sirens wailing louder than anything else. The sound seems to cut through the chaos, a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak night.\nThe building behind us continues to sway, each creak and groan a reminder that we have only escaped by a hair’s breadth. I can feel the tremor still resonating under my feet, as if the whole city were holding its breath, waiting for the next wave of destruction or perhaps the calm after the storm.\nWe step forward into the night, joining the tide of people moving away from the inferno. The wind whips around us, carrying with it the faint scent of rain that promises a wash—perhaps a cleansing of the soot and ash that cling to everything.\nAs we move farther away, I glance back one last time. The skyscraper stands tall, its silhouette stark against the fiery sky, swaying like a wounded beast. Its windows are dark, some shattered, others still glowing with an eerie orange light. It is both beautiful and terrifying—a monument to human ambition, now humbled by forces beyond our control.\nI think of all the meetings that took place in those glass-walled rooms, the deals signed over coffee, the laughter that echoed across the floorboards. All of it feels like a different life, a distant echo muffled by the roar of flames and the pounding of my heart.\nThe rain begins to fall—soft at first, then heavier, each droplet striking the pavement with a gentle sizzle as if trying to douse the fire itself. I lift my face to the sky, feeling the cool water soak through my hair, mixing with the soot on my skin. It feels cleansing, a reminder that even in destruction there is renewal.\nMarco and I keep walking, our footsteps merging with the rhythm of countless others fleeing the disaster. The city around us seems both fragile and resilient—a web of lives intertwined by steel, glass, and now, fire. In the distance, the skyscraper continues its slow sway, a silent sentinel bearing witness to all that has transpired.\nI close my eyes for a brief moment, inhaling the rain‑laden air, letting it fill my lungs and push out the lingering taste of smoke. When I open them again, the world is a blur of water, lights, and motion. The building’s sway feels like a memory now—a pulse that will echo in my mind long after the flames have been extinguished.\nAnd as we disappear into the night, I whisper to myself, almost inaudibly: “We survived.” The words hang in the damp air, fragile yet unbreakable, just like the city itself.\nOUTPUT [temp 1.2]:\n[[[thinking]]]\nWe need to write a 1000-word vivid scene in first person, POV character named Diana. Opening line should include \"The skyscraper sways, as I watch the window in front...\" something like that.\nNeed vivid description, internal thoughts, action. Must be about 1000 words (approx). Use present tense? Likely present or past? Could be present to increase immediacy. We must ensure it's approx 1000 words, maybe 950-1050.\nWe'll craft scene: Diana in a high-rise office building; a window explodes; she watches debris; skyscraper sways due to earthquake/terror attack; internal monologue about fear, her job, perhaps a spy or journalist? We'll keep it intense. Use sensory details, sound, shaking, etc. Also possibly includes some backstory.\nWe'll produce approx 1000 words: count manually approximate. Usually ~15-20 words per line. Let's aim for around 130 sentences average maybe 7-8 words each => about 1400 words? Too many. Need careful length. 1000 words is about 6-7 paragraphs of ~150-180 words each.\nWe'll write approx 9 paragraphs of ~110 words each = 990. Good.\nLet's craft.\nWe need to ensure we include that line exactly: \"The skyscraper sways, as I watch the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode...\" We'll incorporate that early.\nNow produce final answer with scene.\n[[[ end thinking ]]]\nThe skyscraper sways, as I watch the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode—shards of glass hurling outward like angry fireflies, a flash of orange‑red light spilling into my cubicle and painting the gray walls with the brief, frantic pulse of something gone terribly wrong. My breath catches; the air feels thin, charged, as if someone had pulled the plug from the world’s static hum and replaced it with the low‑frequency rumble of an angry beast.\nFor a heartbeat I’m rooted to my chair, the swivel base creaking under the sudden shift. The whole building quivers—metal joints sighing, concrete flexing in a way that makes my stomach twist into knots. Outside, the city’s usual drone of traffic and distant sirens is swallowed by an ominous, metallic groan that seems to come from the very spine of this glass monolith.\nI glance down at the spreadsheet on my monitor; the numbers blur, turning into meaningless smears as a wave of vertigo rolls over me. My hand finds the edge of the desk, nails digging into the wood like desperate anchors. The fluorescent lights flicker, stuttering in rhythm with my racing heart, then snap back to their cold white glare as if nothing had happened at all.\n“Diana!” a voice shouts from the hallway—a low, panicked male tone that cuts through the haze. I turn, eyes narrowing, trying to locate its source amid the shifting panorama of broken glass and twisted metal that now clings to the building’s outer skin like a wounded beast’s scales.\nThe emergency alarms wail—shrill, discordant notes that make my ears ring. Red strobe lights begin flashing, casting jagged shadows across the carpeted floor. A gust of hot air rushes through the gaping hole where the window once was, carrying with it an acrid smell of burning insulation and something else…something metallic, like blood.\nMy mind flips to the briefing I received just this morning: “Potential threat level elevated—stay alert.” The words echo in my head, absurdly disconnected from the raw panic that now coils around my ribs. It was supposed to be a normal day: coffee in the break room, an afternoon meeting about quarterly projections, a quick call with Mom. Now I’m watching a piece of concrete dislodge itself from the façade and tumble into the street below like a slow‑moving meteor.\nA tremor rolls through the structure again, more pronounced this time, as if the building is trying to right itself after the shock. The floor beneath my shoes vibrates, sending tiny dust motes dancing in shafts of light that slice through the broken window. I can hear distant shattering—more panes giving way, a cascade of glass that sounds like an angry sea breaking against cliffs.\nI force myself up, legs stiff and shaking. My hand brushes the metal railing of my desk, cold and slick with condensation from the sudden temperature drop. The emergency exit sign glows an urgent amber, beckoning. A surge of adrenaline propels me forward; I can’t stay where the floor is suddenly a slab of uncertainty, the walls trembling like a heart in distress.\n“Everyone, evacuate to the stairs!” someone shouts, their voice cracked and reverberating through the hallway. The words are a lifeline, but each footstep feels as if I'm walking on a boat caught in rough seas—unsteady, uncertain, each tread threatening to send me over the edge of this precarious platform.\nThe fire escape doors hiss open, revealing stairwells that climb into darkness like gaping mouths waiting to swallow us whole. I catch sight of my reflection in a piece of shattered glass still hanging on the frame: hair mussed, eyes wide, cheeks flushed with the glow of emergency lights. A part of me feels detached—an observer watching someone else’s fear unfold—while another part, raw and visceral, knows that every second counts.\nMy chest tightens as I slide my hand into the steel doorframe, feeling its cold surface vibrate in sympathy with the building. The vibrations travel up my arm, a reminder that this is not a movie set; it’s real, it’s now, and there are lives dangling on the edge of each breath we take.\nA sudden roar erupts from outside—metal grinding against metal as the upper floors start to buckle. I can see the distant silhouette of an aircraft, a faint smudge in the sky that could be a helicopter or a drone, hovering near the top of the tower like a predatory bird. My mind whirls, connecting dots I don’t fully understand: the vague intel about “possible airborne threat,” the sudden surge of tension in the control room earlier, and now this chaotic ballet of destruction.\nI press my back against the stairwell wall, knees barely brushing the floor, trying to steady myself. The world outside the broken window is a blur of orange flames licking the sky, people screaming on the streets below, emergency vehicles rushing past like silver streaks. I can hear sirens wailing—police, fire, ambulances—each sound layered over the other, forming an ugly symphony of alarm.\nMy thoughts flash to my sister, Maya, who works two blocks away in a small bakery. “Don’t forget to call me tonight,” she texted this morning, laughing about her new cat. I imagine her holding a fresh croissant, oblivious to any danger, and a pang of guilt pricks at my throat: why am I here, stuck between spreadsheets and shattered glass while she probably sleeps peacefully?\nThe shaking intensifies. The entire building seems to breathe—inhale, exhale—a living organism caught in a fit of convulsions. Concrete cracks audibly, tiny dust particles raining down like ash from an ancient volcano. A low, guttural groan erupts from somewhere deep within the core, vibrating through my teeth.\nI take another step down, each footfall echoing against the steel railing, feeling the tremor pulse up into my legs. The stairs are slick with a thin film of oil—perhaps from a ruptured pipe earlier, perhaps just condensation—but they’re still solid enough to carry me away from this falling tower.\nA sudden, sharp crack snaps behind me: the balcony rail gives way, sending a cascade of metal bars clattering down into the hallway. A flash of white-hot embers spills onto my peripheral vision; the fire alarm’s shrill wail merges with the sound of breaking steel. The world feels smaller, more urgent—every breath is a gamble.\nI glance back toward where I was moments ago: the 21st‑floor window, now a jagged wound in the building’s skin, smoke seeping out like a sigh. The explosion had sent a pulse through the structure that still reverberates, making the entire edifice sway as if some invisible hand were trying to pry it apart.\nMy mind races. I think of my training—first aid, emergency protocols, calming breaths. I inhale, counting slowly: one…two…three, letting air fill my lungs despite the metallic tang that lingers on the back of my tongue. Exhale, let go of the panic that claws at my throat. My pulse steadies a fraction; it’s not enough to stop the terror, but it keeps me moving.\nA hand grabs mine—a coworker, his face pale, eyes wide, as if he too has been staring at the same broken window and seen something unforgivable. We exchange no words; our grip is an unspoken agreement that we’ll make it out together, that we won’t let this tower take us down.\nWe surge forward, stepping onto a metal platform that leads to an auxiliary fire stair. The tremor hits again, more violent than before. A distant crash sounds like a massive beam giving way on the 30th floor, a sound so deafening it seems to flatten everything in its path. Dust rains down like gray snow, coating my hair, my clothes.\nI keep looking back as we descend, half‑expecting to see the whole building tilt, to watch the world turn upside‑down. The skyline outside remains stubbornly static; skyscrapers beyond our own stand tall, indifferent, their glass facades glimmering under a sky that now feels both ominous and merciful.\nAt the bottom of the stairs, an open doorway spills bright daylight onto the concrete floor, a stark contrast to the darkness we left behind. The air outside hits me cold and clean; it smells like rain on hot asphalt, the kind of scent you can’t help but inhale deeply when you’ve been trapped inside a suffocating metal cage.\nI step out onto the street, my shoes slapping against the wet pavement as a sudden downpour begins, each droplet sounding like tiny explosions in my ears. People scatter, some crying, others shouting commands to emergency crews, faces lit by the flickering red of fire trucks that have arrived with sirens wailing louder than any alarm I’ve heard inside.\nI glance back once more, toward the towering monolith that was once my office building. Its upper half has collapsed into a jagged silhouette against the clouds—a broken tooth in an otherwise perfect smile. Smoke curls up like an angry phantom, drifting slowly away into the gray sky.\nMy heart thunders in my chest as I realize that we’re safe for now, that the ground beneath my feet is solid, that the world continues beyond this disaster. But the image of that shattering window—of glass and fire spilling through a crack in reality—burns itself onto my mind like an ember that refuses to be snuffed out.\nMaya’s voice comes to me in a whisper, “Don’t forget to call me tonight.” I smile despite everything, feeling a strange mix of gratitude and terror. The rain masks the sound of distant sirens, but inside my head there is a new rhythm—a drumbeat that tells me I survived, that I will carry this story forward, that the skyscraper’s sway has left an indelible mark on my soul.\nI raise my hand, brushing away a streak of ash from my cheek, and step into the gathering crowd, ready to face whatever comes next. The city around me is alive, trembling, resilient—just like me.",

MamayLM-Gemma-3-12B-IT-v1.0 is free to use and distributed under the Gemma Terms of Use. This model was created by INSAIT, part of Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski, in Sofia, Bulgaria.\nModel description\nThe model was built on top of Google’s Gemma 3 12B open models. It was continuously pre-trained on a large pre-filtered dataset using the combination of data mixing and model merging, allowing the model to gain outstanding Ukrainian cultural and linguistic capabilities while retaining its English performance.  During the pre-training stage, we use various datasets, including Ukrainian web crawl data (Kobza), freely available datasets such as Wikipedia, a range of specialized Ukrainian datasets, and machine translations of popular English datasets. The model was then instruction-fine-tuned on a newly constructed Ukrainian instruction dataset created using machine translations of current best English datasets and specialized Ukrainian datasets, prepared by Ukrainian community. For more information check our blogpost (available in English and Ukrainian).\nBenchmarks and Results\nWe evaluate our models on a set of standard English benchmarks, a translated version of them in Ukrainian, as well as, Ukrainian specific benchmarks we collected:\nWinogrande challenge: testing world knowledge and understanding\nHellaswag: testing sentence completion\nARC Easy/Challenge: testing logical reasoning\nTriviaQA: testing trivia knowledge\nGSM-8k: solving multiple-choice questions in high-school mathematics\nMMLU: testing knowledge on a multitude of topics\nIFEval: testing instruction-following skills\nZNO: testing knowledge of the Ukrainian high school curriculum in Ukrainian language & literature, history, mathematics and geography\nThese benchmarks test logical reasoning, mathematics, knowledge, language understanding and other skills of the models and are provided at https://github.com/insait-institute/lm-evaluation-harness-uk. The graphs above show the performance of MamayLM 12B compared to other large open models. The results show the excellent abilities of MamayLM in Ukrainian, which allow them to outperform much larger models, including Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5 72B and Meta’s Llama3.1 70B. Finally, our models retain the excellent English performance inherited from the original Google Gemma 3 models upon which they are based.\nMamayLM v1.0 12B also shows improved performance on visual benchmarks like MMMU and ZNO-Vision(MMZNO):\nUse in 🤗 Transformers\nFirst install the latest version of the transformers library:\npip install -U 'transformers[torch]'\nThen load the model in transformers:\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n\"INSAIT-Institute/MamayLM-Gemma-3-12B-IT-v1.0\",\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\nattn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\n)\nRecommended Parameters\nFor optimal performance, we recommend the following parameters for text generation, as we have extensively tested our model with them:\nfrom transformers import GenerationConfig\ngeneration_params = GenerationConfig(\nmax_new_tokens=2048,              # Choose maximum generation tokens\ntemperature=0.1,\ntop_k=25,\ntop_p=1,\nrepetition_penalty=1.1,\n# eos_token_id=[1,106],\ndo_sample=True\n)\nIn principle, increasing temperature should work adequately as well.\nInstruction format\nIn order to leverage instruction fine-tuning, your prompt should begin with a beginning-of-sequence token <bos> and be formatted in the Gemma 3 chat template. <bos> should only be the first token in a chat sequence.\nE.g.\n<bos><start_of_turn>user\nХто такий Козак Мамай?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nThis format is also available as a chat template via the apply_chat_template() method:\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\n\"INSAIT-Institute/MamayLM-Gemma-3-12B-IT-v1.0\",\nuse_default_system_prompt=False,\n)\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Хто такий Козак Мамай?\"},\n]\ninput_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\nreturn_tensors=\"pt\",\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\nreturn_dict=True\n)\noutputs = model.generate(\n**input_ids,\ngeneration_config=generation_params\n)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\nUse with vLLM\nExample usage with vLLM:\nfrom vllm import LLM, SamplingParams\nfrom vllm.inputs import TokensPrompt\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\n\"INSAIT-Institute/MamayLM-Gemma-3-12B-IT-v1.0\",\nuse_default_system_prompt=False,\n)\nsampling_params = SamplingParams(\nmax_tokens=2048,\ntemperature=0.1,\ntop_k=25,\ntop_p=1,\nrepetition_penalty=1.1,\nstop_token_ids=[1, 106],\n)\nllm = LLM(\nmodel=\"INSAIT-Institute/MamayLM-Gemma-3-12B-IT-v1.0\",\ndtype=\"bfloat16\",\n# enforce_eager=True\n)\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Хто такий Козак Мамай?\"},\n]\nformatted_prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True\n)\ninput_ids = tokenizer(\nformatted_prompt,\nadd_special_tokens=False\n).input_ids\nprompt = TokensPrompt(prompt_token_ids=input_ids)\noutput = llm.generate(\nprompt,\nsampling_params\n)\ngenerated_text = output[0].outputs[0].text\nprint(generated_text)\nUse with GGML / llama.cpp\nThe model and instructions for usage in GGUF format are available at INSAIT-Institute/MamayLM-Gemma-3-12B-IT-v1.0-GGUF.\nCommunity Feedback\nWe welcome feedback from the community to help improve MamayLM.

The Schematron series was purpose‑trained for web scraping, data ingestion, and transforming arbitrary pages into structured records.\nWe're releasing these models in two different sizes:\nSchematron‑8B — marginal quality lift on harder/longer pages\nSchematron‑3B — recommended default; near‑parity quality at ~50% cost of Schematron-8B\nThis model card is dedicated to the smaller Schematron-8B model. Check out Schematron-3B for the smaller model.\nI/O at a glance\nInput: Cleaned HTML + JSON Schema (can be extracted from typed model like Pydantic/Zod)\nOutput: Strictly valid JSON conforming to the provided schema (no narration)\nThe JSON Schema passed as input needs to conform to the schema.org schema.\nHighlights\nSchema-first extraction: 100% schema‑conformant JSON outputs\nLong context: Robust to lengthy, noisy HTML (up to 128K tokens)\nVariants: 3B (default, most cost‑efficient) · 8B (marginal quality lift at ~2× cost)\nModel Details\nFamily: Schematron (3B and 8B)\nContext window: Up to 128K tokens\nInput: Cleaned or raw HTML and a JSON Schema\nOutput: Strict JSON that conforms to the provided schema\nBenchmarks\nHTML-to-JSON Extraction Quality\nWe evaluated extraction quality using Gemini 2.5 Pro as a judge, scoring extractions from 1-5 where 5 represents perfect extraction.\nModel\nLLM-as-Judge Score\nGPT-4.1\n4.74\nSchematron-8B\n4.64\nSchematron-3B\n4.41\nGemini-3B-Base\n2.24\nWeb-Augmented Factuality on SimpleQA\nWe evaluated Schematron's real-world impact on LLM factuality using SimpleQA.\nTest Pipeline:\nQuery Generation: Primary LLM (GPT-5 Nano or GPT-4.1) generates search queries and defines extraction schema\nWeb Search: Search provider (SERP or Exa) retrieves relevant pages\nStructured Extraction: Schematron extracts JSON data from retrieved pages using the schema\nAnswer Synthesis: Primary LLM produces final answer from structured data\nKey findings:\nWeb search paired with JSON extraction improves factuality: Adding Schematron with web retrieval improves GPT-5 Nano's accuracy from 8.54% to 82.87%—nearly a 10x improvement\nSearch provider matters: Exa (82.9%) significantly outperforms SERP (64.2%) for factual retrieval, while also being more cost-effective\nStructured extraction beats raw HTML: Processing raw HTML would require 100k+ tokens for 10 searches; Schematron's JSON extraction reduces this by orders of magnitude\nSmall specialized models win: Schematron-8B (82.87%) outperforms the much larger Gemini 2.5 Flash (80.61%) on this task, showing that fine-tuning for well-defined tasks beats general purpose models\nPerformance scales with model quality: When paired with GPT-4.1, Schematron achieves 85.58% accuracy, showing the approach benefits from stronger base models\nMinimal Quickstart\nUse these local snippets to prepare HTML and compose a schema‑guided prompt.

We recommend providing a system prompt with a specific format (JSON, XML, or YAML) and a given schema to improve accuracy (see the following example).\nSupported languages: English, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\nChat template: LFM2 uses a ChatML-like chat template as follows:\n<|startoftext|><|im_start|>system\nReturn data as a JSON object with the following schema:\\n[...]<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nCaenorhabditis elegans is a free-living transparent nematode about 1 mm in length that lives in temperate soil environments.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n{\n\"species\": \"C. elegans\",\n\"genus\": \"Caenorhabditis\",\n\"description\": \"A free-living transparent nematode about 1 mm in length that lives in temperate soil environments.\",\n[...]{<|im_end|>\nYou can automatically apply it using the dedicated .apply_chat_template() function from Hugging Face transformers.\n⚠️ The model is intended for single-turn conversations.\nThe data used for training these models was primarily synthetic, which allowed us to ensure a diverse data mix. We used a range of document types, domains, styles, lengths, and languages. We also varied the density and distribution of relevant text in the documents. In some cases, the extracted information was clustered in one part of the document; in others, it’s spread throughout. We applied the same approach of ensuring diversity when creating synthetic user requests and designing the structure of the model outputs. The data generation process underwent many iterations, incorporating ideas and feedback from across the Liquid AI team.\n📈 Performance\nWe evaluated LFM2-Extract on a dataset of 5,000 documents, covering over 100 topics with a mix of writing styles, ambiguities, and formats. We used a combination of five metrics to capture a balanced view on syntax, accuracy, and faithfulness:\nSyntax score: Checks whether outputs parse cleanly as valid JSON, XML, or YAML.\nFormat accuracy: Verifies that outputs match the requested format (e.g., JSON when JSON is requested).\nKeyword faithfulness: Measures whether values in the structured output actually appear in the input text.\nAbsolute scoring: A judge LLM scores quality on a 1-5 scale, assessing completeness and correctness of extractions.\nRelative scoring: We ask a judge LLM to choose the best answer between the extraction model’s output and the ground-truth answer.\nLFM2-1.2B-Extract can output complex objects in different languages on a level higher than Gemma 3 27B, a model 22.5 times its size.\n🏃 How to run\nHugging Face: LFM2-1.2B\nllama.cpp: LFM2-1.2B-Extract-GGUF\nLEAP: LEAP model library\nYou can use the following Colab notebooks for easy inference and fine-tuning:\nNotebook\nDescription\nLink\nInference\nRun the model with Hugging Face's transformers library.\nSFT (TRL)\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) notebook with a LoRA adapter using TRL.\nDPO (TRL)\nPreference alignment with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using TRL.\nSFT (Axolotl)\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) notebook with a LoRA adapter using Axolotl.\nSFT (Unsloth)\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) notebook with a LoRA adapter using Unsloth.\n📬 Contact\nIf you are interested in custom solutions with edge deployment, please contact our sales team.",

Compared with the previous version, we have adopted several new strategies, which have improved the consistency and dynamics of the model.\nWe found that the low-noise model can achieve good results by directly using the LoRA from Wan2.1; thus, the low-noise model still adopts the old Wan2.1 LoRA.\nInference\nOur inference framework utilizes lightx2v, a highly efficient inference engine that supports multiple models.

It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking.\nA core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a next-token diffusion framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.\nThe model can synthesize speech up to 90 minutes long with up to 4 distinct speakers, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models.\n➡️ Technical Report: VibeVoice Technical Report\n➡️ Project Page: microsoft/VibeVoice\n➡️ Code: microsoft/VibeVoice-Code\nTraining Details\nTransformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with specialized acoustic and semantic tokenizers and a diffusion-based decoding head.\nLLM: Qwen2.5-1.5B for this release.\nTokenizers:\nAcoustic Tokenizer: Based on a σ-VAE variant (proposed in LatentLM), with a mirror-symmetric encoder-decoder structure featuring 7 stages of modified Transformer blocks. Achieves 3200x downsampling from 24kHz input. Encoder/decoder components are ~340M parameters each.\nSemantic Tokenizer: Encoder mirrors the Acoustic Tokenizer's architecture (without VAE components). Trained with an ASR proxy task.\nDiffusion Head: Lightweight module (4 layers, ~123M parameters) conditioned on LLM hidden states. Predicts acoustic VAE features using a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) process. Uses Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and DPM-Solver (and variants) during inference.\nContext Length: Trained with a curriculum increasing up to 65,536 tokens.\nTraining Stages:\nTokenizer Pre-training: Acoustic and Semantic tokenizers are pre-trained separately.\nVibeVoice Training: Pre-trained tokenizers are frozen; only the LLM and diffusion head parameters are trained. A curriculum learning strategy is used for input sequence length (4k -> 16K -> 32K -> 64K). Text tokenizer not explicitly specified, but the LLM (Qwen2.5) typically uses its own.

VibeVoice inherits any biases, errors, or omissions produced by its base model (specifically, Qwen2.5 1.5b in this release).\nPotential for Deepfakes and Disinformation: High-quality synthetic speech can be misused to create convincing fake audio content for impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users must ensure transcripts are reliable, check content accuracy, and avoid using generated content in misleading ways. Users are expected to use the generated content and to deploy the models in a lawful manner, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions. It is best practice to disclose the use of AI when sharing AI-generated content.\nEnglish and Chinese only: Transcripts in language other than English or Chinese may result in unexpected audio outputs.\nNon-Speech Audio: The model focuses solely on speech synthesis and does not handle background noise, music, or other sound effects.\nOverlapping Speech: The current model does not explicitly model or generate overlapping speech segments in conversations.\nRecommendations\nWe do not recommend using VibeVoice in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development. This model is intended for research and development purposes only. Please use responsibly.\nTo mitigate the risks of misuse, we have:\nEmbedded an audible disclaimer (e.g. “This segment was generated by AI”) automatically into every synthesized audio file.\nAdded an imperceptible watermark to generated audio so third parties can verify VibeVoice provenance. Please see contact information at the end of this model card.\nLogged inference requests (hashed) for abuse pattern detection and publishing aggregated statistics quarterly.\nUsers are responsible for sourcing their datasets legally and ethically. This may include securing appropriate rights and/or anonymizing data prior to use with VibeVoice. Users are reminded to be mindful of data privacy concerns.\nContact\nThis project was conducted by members of Microsoft Research. We welcome feedback and collaboration from our audience.

Leveraging an extensive dataset and structured captions involving multiple expert models, we significantly enhance text-image alignment capabilities. The model employs a highly expressive VAE with a (32 × 32) spatial compression ratio, substantially reducing computational costs.\nOur architecture consists of two stages:\n​Base text-to-image Model:​​ The first stage is a text-to-image model that utilizes two text encoders: a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to improve image-text alignment, and a multi-language, character-aware encoder to enhance text rendering across various languages. This stage features a single- and dual-stream diffusion transformer with 17 billion parameters. To optimize aesthetics and structural coherence, we apply reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).\nRefiner Model: The second stage introduces a refiner model that further enhances image quality and clarity, while minimizing artifacts.\nAdditionally, we developed the PromptEnhancer module to further boost model performance, and employed meanflow distillation for efficient inference. HunyuanImage-2.1 demonstrates robust semantic alignment and cross-scenario generalization, leading to improved consistency between text and image, enhanced control of scene details, character poses, and expressions, and the ability to generate multiple objects with distinct descriptions.\nHunyuanImage-2.1 Overall Pipeline\nTraining Data and Caption\nStructured captions provide hierarchical semantic information at short, medium, long, and extra-long levels, significantly enhancing the model’s responsiveness to complex semantics. Innovatively, an OCR agent and IP RAG are introduced to address the shortcomings of general VLM captioners in dense text and world knowledge descriptions, while a bidirectional verification strategy ensures caption accuracy.\nText-to-Image Model Architecture\nCore Components:\nHigh-Compression VAE with REPA Training Acceleration:\nA VAE with a 32× compression rate drastically reduces the number of input tokens for the DiT model. By aligning its feature space with DINOv2 features, we facilitate the training of high-compression VAEs. As a result, our model generates 2K images with the same token length (and thus similar inference time) as other models require for 1K images, achieving superior inference efficiency.\nMulti-bucket, multi-resolution REPA loss aligns DiT features with a high-dimensional semantic feature space, accelerating model convergence.\nDual Text Encoder:\nA vision-language multimodal encoder is employed to better understand scene descriptions, character actions, and detailed requirements.\nA multilingual ByT5 text encoder is introduced to specialize in text generation and multilingual expression.\nNetwork: A single- and dual-stream diffusion transformer with 17 billion parameters.\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\nTwo-Stage Post-Training with Reinforcement Learning: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are applied sequentially in two post-training stages. We introduce a Reward Distribution Alignment algorithm, which innovatively incorporates high-quality images as selected samples to ensure stable and improved reinforcement learning outcomes.\nRewriting Model\nThe first systematic industrial-level rewriting model. SFT training structurally rewrites user text instructions to enrich visual expression, while GRPO training employs a fine-grained semantic AlignEvaluator reward model to substantially improve the semantics of images generated from rewritten text. The AlignEvaluator covers 6 major categories and 24 fine-grained assessment points. PromptEnhancer supports both Chinese and English rewriting and demonstrates general applicability in enhancing semantics for both open-source and proprietary text-to-image models.\nModel distillation\nWe propose a novel distillation method based on meanflow that addresses the key challenges of instability and inefficiency inherent in standard meanflow training. This approach enables high-quality image generation with only a few sampling steps. To our knowledge, this is the first successful application of meanflow to an industrial-scale model.\n🎉 HunyuanImage-2.1 Key Features\nHigh-Quality Generation: Efficiently produces ultra-high-definition (2K) images with cinematic composition.\nMultilingual Support: Provides native support for both Chinese and English prompts.\nAdvanced Architecture: Built on a multi-modal, single- and dual-stream combined DiT (Diffusion Transformer) backbone.\nGlyph-Aware Processing: Utilizes ByT5's text rendering capabilities for improved text generation accuracy.\nFlexible Aspect Ratios: Supports a variety of image aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:4, 3:2, 2:3).\nPrompt Enhancement: Automatically rewrites prompts to improve descriptive accuracy and visual quality.\nPrompt Enhanced Demo\nTo improve the quality and detail of generated images, we use a prompt rewriting model. This model automatically enhances user-provided text prompts by adding detailed and descriptive information.\n📈 Comparisons\nSSAE Evaluation\nSSAE (Structured Semantic Alignment Evaluation) is an intelligent evaluation metric for image-text alignment based on advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We extracted 3500 key points across 12 categories, then used multimodal large language models to automatically evaluate and score by comparing the generated images with these key points based on the visual content of the images. Mean Image Accuracy represents the image-wise average score across all key points, while Global Accuracy directly calculates the average score across all key points.\nModel Open Source Mean Image Accuracy Global Accuracy Primary Subject Secondary Subject Scene Other\nNoun Key Attributes Other Attributes Action Noun Attributes Action Noun Attributes Shot Style Composition\nFLUX-dev ✅ 0.7122 0.6995 0.7965 0.7824 0.5993 0.5777 0.7950 0.6826 0.6923 0.8453 0.8094 0.6452 0.7096 0.6190\nSeedream-3.0 ❌ 0.8827 0.8792 0.9490 0.9311 0.8242 0.8177 0.9747 0.9103 0.8400 0.9489 0.8848 0.7582 0.8726 0.7619\nQwen-Image ✅ 0.8854 0.8828 0.9502 0.9231 0.8351 0.8161 0.9938 0.9043 0.8846 0.9613 0.8978 0.7634 0.8548 0.8095\nGPT-Image ❌  0.8952 0.8929 0.9448 0.9289 0.8655 0.8445 0.9494 0.9283 0.8800 0.9432 0.9017 0.7253 0.8582 0.7143\nHunyuanImage 2.1 ✅ 0.8888 0.8832 0.9339 0.9341 0.8363 0.8342 0.9627 0.8870 0.9615 0.9448 0.9254 0.7527 0.8689 0.7619\nFrom the SSAE evaluation results, our model has currently achieved the optimal performance among open-source models in terms of semantic alignment, and is very close to the performance of closed-source commercial models (GPT-Image).\nGSB Evaluation\nWe adopted the GSB evaluation method commonly used to assess the relative performance between two models from an overall image perception perspective. In total, we utilized 1000 text prompts, generating an equal number of image samples for all compared models in a single run. For a fair comparison, we conducted inference only once for each prompt, avoiding any cherry-picking of results. When comparing with the baseline methods, we maintained the default settings for all selected models. The evaluation was performed by more than 100 professional evaluators.\nFrom the results, HunyuanImage 2.1 achieved a relative win rate of -1.36% against Seedream3.0 (closed-source) and 2.89% outperforming Qwen-Image (open-source).

It has 16B total parameters, but only 1.4B are activated per input token (non-embedding 789M). Trained on more than 20T tokens of high-quality data and enhanced through multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, Ling-mini-2.0 achieves remarkable improvements in complex reasoning and instruction following. With just 1.4B activated parameters, it still reaches the top-tier level of sub-10B dense LLMs and even matches or surpasses much larger MoE models.\nStrong General and Professional Reasoning\nWe evaluated Ling-mini-2.0 on challenging general reasoning tasks in coding (LiveCodeBench, CodeForces) and mathematics (AIME 2025, HMMT 2025), as well as knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks across multiple domains (MMLU-Pro, Humanity's Last Exam). Compared with sub-10B dense models (e.g., Qwen3-4B-instruct-2507, Qwen3-8B-nothinking) and larger-scale MoE models (Ernie-4.5-21B-A3B-PT, GPT-OSS-20B/low), Ling-mini-2.0 demonstrated outstanding overall reasoning capabilities.\n7× Equivalent Dense Performance Leverage\nGuided by Ling Scaling Laws, Ling 2.0 adopts a 1/32 activation ratio MoE architecture, with empirically optimized design choices in expert granularity, shared expert ratio, attention ratio, aux-loss free + sigmoid routing strategy, MTP loss, QK-Norm, half RoPE, and more. This enables small-activation MoE models to achieve over 7× equivalent dense performance. In other words, Ling-mini-2.0 with only 1.4B activated parameters (non-embedding 789M) can deliver performance equivalent to a 7–8B dense model.\nHigh-speed Generation at 300+ token/s\nThe highly sparse small-activation MoE architecture also delivers significant training and inference efficiency. In simple QA scenarios (within 2000 tokens), Ling-mini-2.0 generates at 300+ token/s (on H20 deployment) — more than 2× faster than an 8B dense model. Ling-mini-2.0 is able to handle 128K context length with YaRN, as sequence length increases, the relative speedup can reach over 7×.\nOpen-sourced FP8 Efficient Training Solution\nLing 2.0 employs FP8 mixed-precision training throughout. Compared with BF16, experiments with over 1T training tokens show nearly identical loss curves and downstream benchmark performance. To support the community in efficient continued pretraining and fine-tuning under limited compute, we are also open-sourcing our FP8 training solution. Based on tile/blockwise FP8 scaling, it further introduces FP8 optimizer, FP8 on-demand transpose weight, and FP8 padding routing map for extreme memory optimization. On 8/16/32 80G GPUs, compared with LLaMA 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B, Ling-mini-2.0 achieved 30–60% throughput gains with MTP enabled, and 90–120% throughput gains with MTP disabled.\nA More Open Opensource Strategy\nWe believe Ling-mini-2.0 is an ideal starting point for MoE research. For the first time at this scale, it integrates 1/32 sparsity, MTP layers, and FP8 training — achieving both strong effectiveness and efficient training/inference performance, making it a prime candidate for the small-size LLM segment.\nTo further foster community research, in addition to releasing the post-trained version, we are also open-sourcing five pretraining checkpoints: the pre-finetuning Ling-mini-2.0-base, along with four base models trained on 5T, 10T, 15T, and 20T tokens, enabling deeper research and broader applications.\nModel Downloads\nYou can download the following table to see the various stage of Ling-mini-2.0 models(1.43B activated of 16.26B total params). If you are located in mainland China, we also provide the model on ModelScope.cn to speed up the download process.\nModel\nContext Length\nDownload\nLing-mini-base-2.0\n32K -> 128K (YaRN)\n🤗 HuggingFace 🤖 ModelScope\nLing-mini-base-2.0-5T\n4K\n🤗 HuggingFace 🤖 ModelScope\nLing-mini-base-2.0-10T\n4K\n🤗 HuggingFace 🤖 ModelScope\nLing-mini-base-2.0-15T\n4K\n🤗 HuggingFace 🤖 ModelScope\nLing-mini-base-2.0-20T\n4K\n🤗 HuggingFace 🤖 ModelScope\nLing-mini-2.0\n32K -> 128K (YaRN)\n🤗 HuggingFace 🤖 ModelScope\nNote: If you are interested in previous version, please visit the past model collections in Huggingface or ModelScope.\nQuickstart\n🚀 Try Online\nYou can experience Ling-mini-2.0 online at: ZenMux\n🔌 API Usage\nYou can also use Ling-mini-2.0 through API calls:\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n# 1.

With only 16B total parameters and 1.4B activated parameters, it achieves comprehensive reasoning capabilities comparable to dense models below the 10B scale. It excels particularly in logical reasoning, code generation, and mathematical tasks, while supporting 128K long-context processing and 300+ tokens/s high-speed generation.\nEnhanced Reasoning: Joint Training with SFT + RLVR + RLHF\nBuilt upon Ling-mini-2.0-base, Ring-mini-2.0 undergoes further training with Long-CoT SFT, more stable and continuous RLVR, and RLHF joint optimization, significantly improving the stability and generalization of complex reasoning. On multiple challenging benchmarks (LiveCodeBench, AIME 2025, GPQA, ARC-AGI-v1, etc.), it outperforms dense models below 10B and even rivals larger MoE models (e.g., gpt-oss-20B-medium) with comparable output lengths, particularly excelling in logical reasoning.\nHigh Sparsity, High-Speed Generation\nInheriting the efficient MoE design of the Ling 2.0 series, Ring-mini-2.0 activates only 1.4B parameters and achieves performance equivalent to 7–8B dense models through architectural optimizations such as 1/32 expert activation ratio and MTP layers. Thanks to its low activation and high sparsity design, Ring-mini-2.0 delivers a throughput of 300+ tokens/s when deployed on H20. With Expert Dual Streaming inference optimization, this can be further boosted to 500+ tokens/s, significantly reducing inference costs for high-concurrency scenarios involving thinking models. Additionally, with YaRN extrapolation, it supports 128K long-context processing, achieving a relative speedup of up to 7x in long-output scenarios.\nModel Downloads\nModel\n#Total Params\n#Activated Params\nContext Length\nDownload\nRing-mini-2.0\n16.8B\n1.4B\n128K\n🤗 HuggingFace 🤖 Modelscope\nQuickstart\n🤗 Hugging Face Transformers\nHere is a code snippet to show you how to use the chat model with transformers:\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nmodel_name = \"inclusionAI/Ring-mini-2.0\"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_name,\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\ntrust_remote_code=True\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nprompt = \"Give me a short introduction to large language models.\"\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Ring, an assistant created by inclusionAI\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\nenable_thinking=True\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\", return_token_type_ids=False).to(model.device)\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n**model_inputs,\nmax_new_tokens=8192\n)\ngenerated_ids = [\noutput_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)\n]\nresponse = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\nLicense\nThis code repository is licensed under the MIT License.\nProject Page\nAccess the demo and experience the model at: https://zenmux.ai/inclusionai/ring-mini-2.0\nCode\nThe full code repository for this model can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/inclusionAI/Ring-V2\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n@article{lingteam2025every,\ntitle={Every Step Evolves: Scaling Reinforcement Learning for Trillion-Scale Thinking Model},\nauthor={Ling Team and Anqi Shen and Baihui Li and Bin Hu and Bin Jing and Cai Chen and Chao Huang and Chao Zhang and Chaokun Yang and Cheng Lin and Chengyao Wen and Congqi Li and Deng Zhao and Dingbo Yuan and Donghai You and Fagui Mao and Fanzhuang Meng and Feng Xu and Guojie Li and Guowei Wang and Hao Dai and Haonan Zheng and Hong Liu and Jia Guo and Jiaming Liu and Jian Liu and Jianhao Fu and Jiannan Shi and Jianwen Wang and Jianxin Lai and Jin Yang and Jun Mei and Jun Zhou and Junbo Zhao and Junping Zhao and Kuan Xu and Le Su and Lei Chen and Li Tang and Liang Jiang and Liangcheng Fu and Lianhao Xu and Linfeng Shi and Lisha Liao and Longfei Zheng and Meng Li and Mingchun Chen and Qi Zuo and Qiang Cheng and Qianggang Cao and Qitao Shi and Quanrui Guo and Senlin Zhu and Shaofei Wang and Shaomian Zheng and Shuaicheng Li and Shuwei Gu and Siba Chen and Tao Wu and Tao Zhang and Tianyu Zhang and Tianyu Zhou and Tiwei Bie and Tongkai Yang and Wang Hong and Wang Ren and Weihua Chen and Wenbo Yu and Wengang Zheng and Xiangchun Wang and Xiaodong Yan and Xiaopei Wan and Xin Zhao and Xinyu Kong and Xinyu Tang and Xudong Han and Xudong Wang and Xuemin Yang and Xueyu Hu and Yalin Zhang and Yan Sun and Yicheng Shan and Yilong Wang and Yingying Xu and Yongkang Liu and Yongzhen Guo and Yuanyuan Wang and Yuchen Yan and Yuefan Wang and Yuhong Guo and Zehuan Li and Zhankai Xu and Zhe Li and Zhenduo Zhang and Zhengke Gui and Zhenxuan Pan and Zhenyu Huang and Zhenzhong Lan and Zhiqiang Ding and Zhiqiang Zhang and Zhixun Li and Zhizhen Liu and Zihao Wang and Zujie Wen},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2510.18855},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.AI}\n}",

The release includes two categories of models:\nBase models:\nMobileLLM-R1-140M-base\nMobileLLM-R1-360M-base\nMobileLLM-R1-950M-base\nFinal models:\nMobileLLM-R1-140M\nMobileLLM-R1-360M\nMobileLLM-R1-950M\nNote: These models are not general-purpose chat models. They are Supervised Fine-Tuned (SFT) models, specifically trained to address mathematical, programming (Python, C++), and scientific problems.\nIn addition to the models, we release the complete training recipes and data sources to ensure reproducibility and support further research.\nRemarkably, the MobileLLM-R1 950M, pre-trained on only ~2T high-quality tokens and with fewer than 5T total training tokens, achieves comparable or superior performance to Qwen3 0.6B, which was trained on 36T tokens, across MATH, GSM8K, MMLU, and LiveCodeBench benchmarks.\nCompared to existing fully open-source models, MobileLLM-R1 950M model achieves ~5× higher accuracy on MATH compared to the Olmo 1.24B model and ~2× higher accuracy relative to the SmolLM2 1.7B model, despite being substantially smaller in parameter scale. In addition, MobileLLM-R1 950M outperforms both Olmo 1.24B and SmolLM2 1.7B by a wide margin on coding benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art among fully open-source models.\nNews\nSept 12, 2025: 🚀 MobileLLM-R1 models are released on HuggingFace.\nSpet 28, 2025: 🌟 The training code is also available on GitHub.\nSpet 29, 2025: 🎉 The technical report \"MobileLLM-R1: Exploring the Limits of Sub-Billion Language Model Reasoners with Open Training Recipes\" is also available!

For LiveCodeBench, results are reported as the average accuracy across 16 runs. Models with fewer than 400M parameters do not produce reliable AIME scores and are therefore denoted as '—'.\nTraining\nTraining Process\nTraining stages and hyperparameter details\nIn the pretraining phase, MobileLLM-R1 models are randomly initialized and optimized using the Adam optimizer with hyperparameters (β_1, β_2, ε) = (0.9, 0.95, 1e-8), coupled with a weight decay coefficient of 0.1. The learning rate follows a 2k-step warmup schedule and then decays linearly from its peak to 10% of the maximum.\nIn the mid-training phase, we use Adam optimizer with learning rate linearly decays from its maximum value to zero. We employ knowledge distillation with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model as the teacher, where the student is trained via minimizing the KL divergence between its output logits and the teacher logits.\nIn the post-training phase, we use the Adam optimizer with zero weight decay. The learning rate warmup ratio is set to 0.03 for general-purpose SFT and 0.1 for reasoning-specific SFT, and it linearly decays from its maximum value to zero.
