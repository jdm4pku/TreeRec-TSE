We are pleased to introduce Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, featuring the following key enhancements:\nSignificantly improved performance on reasoning tasks, including logical reasoning, mathematics, science, coding, and academic benchmarks that typically require human expertise.\nMarkedly better general capabilities, such as instruction following, tool usage, text generation, and alignment with human preferences.\nEnhanced 256K long-context understanding capabilities.\nNOTE: This version has an increased thinking length. We strongly recommend its use in highly complex reasoning tasks.\nModel Overview\nQwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 has the following features:\nType: Causal Language Models\nTraining Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\nNumber of Parameters: 30.5B in total and 3.3B activated\nNumber of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 29.9B\nNumber of Layers: 48\nNumber of Attention Heads (GQA): 32 for Q and 4 for KV\nNumber of Experts: 128\nNumber of Activated Experts: 8\nContext Length: 262,144 natively.\nNOTE: This model supports only thinking mode. Meanwhile, specifying enable_thinking=True is no longer required.\nAdditionally, to enforce model thinking, the default chat template automatically includes <think>. Therefore, it is normal for the model's output to contain only </think> without an explicit opening <think> tag.\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our blog, GitHub, and Documentation.\nPerformance\nGemini2.5-Flash-Thinking\nQwen3-235B-A22B Thinking\nQwen3-30B-A3B Thinking\nQwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507\nKnowledge\nMMLU-Pro\n81.9\n82.8\n78.5\n80.9\nMMLU-Redux\n92.1\n92.7\n89.5\n91.4\nGPQA\n82.8\n71.1\n65.8\n73.4\nSuperGPQA\n57.8\n60.7\n51.8\n56.8\nReasoning\nAIME25\n72.0\n81.5\n70.9\n85.0\nHMMT25\n64.2\n62.5\n49.8\n71.4\nLiveBench 20241125\n74.3\n77.1\n74.3\n76.8\nCoding\nLiveCodeBench v6 (25.02-25.05)\n61.2\n55.7\n57.4\n66.0\nCFEval\n1995\n2056\n1940\n2044\nOJBench\n23.5\n25.6\n20.7\n25.1\nAlignment\nIFEval\n89.8\n83.4\n86.5\n88.9\nArena-Hard v2$\n56.7\n61.5\n36.3\n56.0\nCreative Writing v3\n85.0\n84.6\n79.1\n84.4\nWritingBench\n83.9\n80.3\n77.0\n85.0\nAgent\nBFCL-v3\n68.6\n70.8\n69.1\n72.4\nTAU1-Retail\n65.2\n54.8\n61.7\n67.8\nTAU1-Airline\n54.0\n26.0\n32.0\n48.0\nTAU2-Retail\n66.7\n40.4\n34.2\n58.8\nTAU2-Airline\n52.0\n30.0\n36.0\n58.0\nTAU2-Telecom\n31.6\n21.9\n22.8\n26.3\nMultilingualism\nMultiIF\n74.4\n71.9\n72.2\n76.4\nMMLU-ProX\n80.2\n80.0\n73.1\n76.4\nINCLUDE\n83.9\n78.7\n71.9\n74.4\nPolyMATH\n49.8\n54.7\n46.1\n52.6\n$ For reproducibility, we report the win rates evaluated by GPT-4.1.\n& For highly challenging tasks (including PolyMATH and all reasoning and coding tasks), we use an output length of 81,920 tokens. For all other tasks, we set the output length to 32,768.\nQuickstart\nThe code of Qwen3-MoE has been in the latest Hugging Face transformers and we advise you to use the latest version of transformers.\nWith transformers<4.51.0, you will encounter the following error:\nKeyError: 'qwen3_moe'\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507\"\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_name,\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = \"Give me a short introduction to large language model.\"\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n**model_inputs,\nmax_new_tokens=32768\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\n# parsing thinking content\ntry:\n# rindex finding 151668 (</think>)\nindex = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)\nexcept ValueError:\nindex = 0\nthinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True).strip(\"\\n\")\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip(\"\\n\")\nprint(\"thinking content:\", thinking_content) # no opening <think> tag\nprint(\"content:\", content)\nFor deployment, you can use sglang>=0.4.6.post1 or vllm>=0.8.5 or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:\nSGLang:python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 --context-length 262144  --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1\nvLLM:vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 --max-model-len 262144 --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1\nNote: If you encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues, you may consider reducing the context length to a smaller value. However, since the model may require longer token sequences for reasoning, we strongly recommend using a context length greater than 131,072 when possible.\nFor local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.\nAgentic Use\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using Qwen-Agent to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n# Define LLM\n# Using Alibaba Cloud Model Studio\nllm_cfg = {\n'model': 'qwen3-30b-a3b-thinking-2507',\n'model_type': 'qwen_dashscope',\n}\n# Using OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. It is recommended to disable the reasoning and the tool call parsing\n# functionality of the deployment frameworks and let Qwen-Agent automate the related operations.

However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\nAdequate Output Length: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 81,920 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\nStandardize Output Format: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\nMath Problems: Include \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" in the prompt.\nMultiple-Choice Questions: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: \"Please show your choice in the answer field with only the choice letter, e.g., \"answer\": \"C\".\"\nNo Thinking Content in History: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.\nHelp, Adjustments, Samplers, Parameters and More\nCHANGE THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE EXPERTS:\nSee this document:\nhttps://huggingface.co/DavidAU/How-To-Set-and-Manage-MOE-Mix-of-Experts-Model-Activation-of-Experts\nSettings: CHAT / ROLEPLAY and/or SMOOTHER operation of this model:\nIn \"KoboldCpp\" or  \"oobabooga/text-generation-webui\" or \"Silly Tavern\" ;\nSet the \"Smoothing_factor\" to 1.5\n: in KoboldCpp -> Settings->Samplers->Advanced-> \"Smooth_F\"\n: in text-generation-webui -> parameters -> lower right.\n: In Silly Tavern this is called: \"Smoothing\"\nNOTE: For \"text-generation-webui\"\n-> if using GGUFs you need to use \"llama_HF\" (which involves downloading some config files from the SOURCE version of this model)\nSource versions (and config files) of my models are here:\nhttps://huggingface.co/collections/DavidAU/d-au-source-files-for-gguf-exl2-awq-gptq-hqq-etc-etc-66b55cb8ba25f914cbf210be\nOTHER OPTIONS:\nIncrease rep pen to 1.1 to 1.15 (you don't need to do this if you use \"smoothing_factor\")\nIf the interface/program you are using to run AI MODELS supports \"Quadratic Sampling\" (\"smoothing\") just make the adjustment as noted.\nHighest Quality Settings / Optimal Operation Guide / Parameters and Samplers\nThis a \"Class 1\" model:\nFor all settings used for this model (including specifics for its \"class\"), including example generation(s) and for advanced settings guide (which many times addresses any model issue(s)), including methods to improve model performance for all use case(s) as well as chat, roleplay and other use case(s) please see:\n[ https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Maximizing-Model-Performance-All-Quants-Types-And-Full-Precision-by-Samplers_Parameters ]\nYou can see all parameters used for generation, in addition to advanced parameters and samplers to get the most out of this model here:\n[ https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Maximizing-Model-Performance-All-Quants-Types-And-Full-Precision-by-Samplers_Parameters ]\nWhat is Brainstorm?\nBrainstorm 20x\nThe BRAINSTORM process was developed by David_AU.\nSome of the core principals behind this process are discussed in this\nscientific paper : Progressive LLaMA with Block Expansion .\nHowever I went in a completely different direction from what was outlined in this paper.\nWhat is \"Brainstorm\" ?\nThe reasoning center of an LLM is taken apart, reassembled, and expanded.\nIn this case for this model: 20 times\nThen these centers are individually calibrated. These \"centers\" also interact with each other.\nThis introduces subtle changes into the reasoning process.\nThe calibrations further adjust - dial up or down - these \"changes\" further.\nThe number of centers (5x,10x etc) allow more \"tuning points\" to further customize how the model reasons so to speak.\nThe core aim of this process is to increase the model's detail, concept and connection to the \"world\",\ngeneral concept connections, prose quality and prose length without affecting instruction following.\nThis will also enhance any creative use case(s) of any kind, including \"brainstorming\", creative art form(s) and like case uses.\nHere are some of the enhancements this process brings to the model's performance:\nProse generation seems more focused on the moment to moment.\nSometimes there will be \"preamble\" and/or foreshadowing present.\nFewer or no \"cliches\"\nBetter overall prose and/or more complex / nuanced prose.\nA greater sense of nuance on all levels.\nCoherence is stronger.\nDescription is more detailed, and connected closer to the content.\nSimile and Metaphors are stronger and better connected to the prose, story, and character.\nSense of \"there\" / in the moment is enhanced.\nDetails are more vivid, and there are more of them.\nProse generation length can be long to extreme.\nEmotional engagement is stronger.\nThe model will take FEWER liberties vs a normal model: It will follow directives more closely but will \"guess\" less.\nThe MORE instructions and/or details you provide the more strongly the model will respond.\nDepending on the model \"voice\" may be more \"human\" vs original model's \"voice\".\nOther \"lab\" observations:\nThis process does not, in my opinion, make the model 5x or 10x \"smarter\" - if only that was true!\nHowever, a change in \"IQ\" was not an issue / a priority, and was not tested or calibrated for so to speak.\nFrom lab testing it seems to ponder, and consider more carefully roughly speaking.\nYou could say this process sharpens the model's focus on it's task(s) at a deeper level.\nThe process to modify the model occurs at the root level - source files level. The model can quanted as a GGUF, EXL2, AWQ etc etc.",

Here are the key components:\nWeb Documents: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is exposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. The training dataset includes content in over 100 languages.\nCode and Technical Documents: Exposing the model to code and technical documentation helps it learn the structure and patterns of programming languages and specialized scientific content, which improves its understanding of code and technical questions.\nSynthetic and Task-Specific Data: Synthetically training data helps to teach the model specific skills. This includes curated data for tasks like information retrieval, classification, and sentiment analysis, which helps to fine-tune its performance for common embedding applications.\nThe combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful multilingual embedding model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and data formats.\nData Preprocessing\nHere are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training data:\nCSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering was applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure the exclusion of harmful and illegal content.\nSensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models safe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain personal information and other sensitive data from training sets.\nAdditional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in line with our policies.\nModel Development\nHardware\nEmbeddingGemma was trained using the latest generation of Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware (TPUv5e), for more details refer to the Gemma 3 model card.\nSoftware\nTraining was done using JAX and ML Pathways. For more details refer to the Gemma 3 model card.\nEvaluation\nBenchmark Results\nThe model was evaluated against a large collection of different datasets and metrics to cover different aspects of text understanding.\nFull Precision Checkpoint\nMTEB (Multilingual, v2)\nDimensionality\nMean (Task)\nMean (TaskType)\n768d\n61.15\n54.31\n512d\n60.71\n53.89\n256d\n59.68\n53.01\n128d\n58.23\n51.77\nMTEB (English, v2)\nDimensionality\nMean (Task)\nMean (TaskType)\n768d\n68.36\n64.15\n512d\n67.80\n63.59\n256d\n66.89\n62.94\n128d\n65.09\n61.56\nMTEB (Code, v1)\nDimensionality\nMean (Task)\nMean (TaskType)\n768d\n68.76\n68.76\n512d\n68.48\n68.48\n256d\n66.74\n66.74\n128d\n62.96\n62.96\nQAT Checkpoints\nMTEB (Multilingual, v2)\nQuant config (dimensionality)\nMean (Task)\nMean (TaskType)\nQ4_0 (768d)\n60.62\n53.61\nQ8_0 (768d)\n60.93\n53.95\nMixed Precision* (768d)\n60.69\n53.82\nMTEB (English, v2)\nQuant config (dimensionality)\nMean (Task)\nMean (TaskType)\nQ4_0 (768d)\n67.91\n63.64\nQ8_0 (768d)\n68.13\n63.85\nMixed Precision* (768d)\n67.95\n63.83\nMTEB (Code, v1)\nQuant config (dimensionality)\nMean (Task)\nMean (TaskType)\nQ4_0 (768d)\n67.99\n67.99\nQ8_0 (768d)\n68.70\n68.70\nMixed Precision* (768d)\n68.03\n68.03\nNote: QAT models are evaluated after quantization\n* Mixed Precision refers to per-channel quantization with int4 for embeddings, feedforward, and projection layers, and int8 for attention (e4_a8_f4_p4).\nPrompt Instructions\nEmbeddingGemma can generate optimized embeddings for various use cases—such as document retrieval, question answering, and fact verification—or for specific input types—either a query or a document—using prompts that are prepended to the input strings.\nQuery prompts follow the form task: {task description} | query:  where the task description varies by the use case, with the default task description being search result. Document-style prompts follow the form title: {title | \"none\"} | text:  where the title is either none (the default) or the actual title of the document. Note that providing a title, if available, will improve model performance for document prompts but may require manual formatting.\nUse the following prompts based on your use case and input data type. These may already be available in the EmbeddingGemma configuration in your modeling framework of choice.\nUse Case (task type enum)\nDescriptions\nRecommended Prompt\nRetrieval (Query)\nUsed to generate embeddings that are optimized for document search or information retrieval\ntask: search result | query: {content}\nRetrieval (Document)\ntitle: {title | \"none\"} | text: {content}\nQuestion Answering\ntask: question answering | query: {content}\nFact Verification\ntask: fact checking | query: {content}\nClassification\nUsed to generate embeddings that are optimized to classify texts according to preset labels\ntask: classification | query: {content}\nClustering\nUsed to generate embeddings that are optimized to cluster texts based on their similarities\ntask: clustering | query: {content}\nSemantic Similarity\nUsed to generate embeddings that are optimized to assess text similarity. This is not intended for retrieval use cases.\ntask: sentence similarity | query: {content}\nCode Retrieval\nUsed to retrieve a code block based on a natural language query, such as sort an array or reverse a linked list. Embeddings of the code blocks are computed using retrieval_document.\ntask: code retrieval | query: {content}\nUsage and Limitations\nThese models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.\nIntended Usage\nOpen embedding models have a wide range of applications across various industries and domains. The following list of potential uses is not comprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information about the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model training and development.\nSemantic Similarity: Embeddings optimized to assess text similarity, such as recommendation systems and duplicate detection\nClassification: Embeddings optimized to classify texts according to preset labels, such as sentiment analysis and spam detection\nClustering: Embeddings optimized to cluster texts based on their similarities, such as document organization, market research, and anomaly detection\nRetrieval\nDocument: Embeddings optimized for document search, such as indexing articles, books, or web pages for search\nQuery: Embeddings optimized for general search queries, such as custom search\nCode Query: Embeddings optimized for retrieval of code blocks based on natural language queries, such as code suggestions and search\nQuestion Answering: Embeddings for questions in a question-answering system, optimized for finding documents that answer the question, such as chatbox.\nFact Verification: Embeddings for statements that need to be verified, optimized for retrieving documents that contain evidence supporting or refuting the statement, such as automated fact-checking systems.\nLimitations\nTraining Data\nThe quality and diversity of the training data significantly influence the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data can lead to limitations in the model's responses.\nThe scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas the model can handle effectively.\nLanguage Ambiguity and Nuance\nNatural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle to grasp subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\nEthical Considerations and Risks\nRisks identified and mitigations:\nPerpetuation of biases: It's encouraged to perform continuous monitoring (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of de-biasing techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use cases.\nMisuse for malicious purposes: Technical limitations and developer and end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of embeddings. Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag misuse are provided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the Gemma Prohibited Use Policy.\nPrivacy violations: Models were trained on data filtered for removal of certain personal information and other sensitive data. Developers are encouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving techniques.\nBenefits\nAt the time of release, this family of models provides high-performance open embedding model implementations designed from the ground up for responsible AI development compared to similarly sized models. Using the benchmark evaluation metrics described in this document, these models have shown superior performance to other, comparably-sized open model alternatives.",
