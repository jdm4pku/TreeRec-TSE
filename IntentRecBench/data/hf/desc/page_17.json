This one actually works.\nThe secret? Selective quantization: I only quantized the language model (the most robust part), while keeping audio-critical components (diffusion head, VAE, connectors) at full precision.\nResults\n✅ Perfect audio, identical to the original model\n✅ 11.6 GB instead of 18.7 GB (-38%)\n✅ Uses ~12 GB VRAM instead of 20 GB\n✅ Works on 12 GB GPUs (RTX 3060, 4070 Ti, etc.)\n🚨 The Problem with Other 8-bit Models\nMost 8-bit models you'll find online quantize everything aggressively:\nResult: Audio components get quantized → numerical errors propagate → audio = pure noise.\n✅ The Solution: Selective Quantization\nI only quantized what can be safely quantized without losing quality.\nResult: 52% of parameters quantized, 48% at full precision = perfect audio quality.\n📊 Quick Comparison\nModel\nSize\nAudio Quality\nStatus\nOriginal VibeVoice\n18.7 GB\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nFull precision\nOther 8-bit models\n10.6 GB\n💥 NOISE\n❌ Don't work\nThis model\n11.6 GB\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n✅ Perfect\n+1.0 GB vs other 8-bit models = perfect audio instead of noise.

Your support helps me chug along in this brave new world.\nFAQ for those out-of-the-loop\n🐶 Who is Drummer?\nHi! I'm Drummer. I'm a Software Engineer with experience in JavaScript, Golang, Python, and generally engineering the crap out of things.\nWhy I'm in the AI space:\nExploration: Everyone is trying to figure out how AI works and what it's capable of. I am too - just not in creating the smartest, safest model at all costs.\nUpskill: The world is headed towards AI. It is here to stay. This has been my way of brushing up in this new form of computing challenge.\nValue: I yearn to create value. I feel satisfaction and fulfillment in providing something meaningful for others.\nFun: It's just fun using and making models. It's also fun coming up with theories and realizing them in practice (training AI).\nI started my tuning venture back in mid-2024 when I wanted to improve its literary capabilities.\nI've come a long way since then and I have branched out and specialized.\nFoundational models today are optimized for non-creative uses, and I believe there is a place for AI in creativity and entertainment.\nI am here to take the road less traveled by.\n❓ What are my models like?\nBottomline: My models are usually geared towards creativity, usability, and entertainment!\nWhile intelligence, correctness, and problem solving are not my priority, they are still one of many qualities I want in my models.\nThe primary goal is to enhance the experience for users looking to use models for creative uses, and other use cases which require no alignment.\nIn an effort to make it clear to myself and to others what I'm aiming for, I've identified certain qualities that my users often want:\nCreativity\nWriting: Does it string together words and sentences in a pleasant & effective way? Does it feel like a writer?\nDynamism: How good is the AI at being compelling and intriguing in its storytelling?\nImagination: Can the AI navigate through a plethora of possibilities? Can it skirt incoherence and rise up to absolute coherence at the end of it?\n(Dis)alignment\nAttitude: Does it refuse in both soft or hard ways? Does it lean towards certain corporate/religious/political ethics & beliefs? How does it see the user and itself?\nMorality: Does it know ethics? Is its language infected with forced positivity? If not, can it still moralize over difficult & dubious themes?\nFormatting: How stubborn is it with its established formatting? Can it create effective and novel formats to answer the prompt?\nIntelligence\nAdherence: Can it follow instructions? Is it sticking to the prompt? Can it understsand you?\nKnowledge: Does it know about the world in both fictional and non-fictional way?\nPerception: Can it handle nuance, complexity, and logic?\nIf it doesn't excel in one of these qualities, or if it's overall mediocre for its size, then I would most likely reiterate until I get something right.\n💡 Philosophy\nA person is defined by the language they use. Not whether they speak in English or German, but in how they perceive reality.\nJust like how we associate a serial killer as a mind that can't map 'murder' to 'evil', an innocent person is a mind that simply can't imagine 'murder'. They get confused when forced to deal with such subjects.\nAI's use of language speaks volumes about their 'perception' of reality. If a language model has been skewed and limited to a positive perception, then it's ability to imagine is also limited.\nFinetuning is an opportunity to adjust and broaden the language. Corporations use it to achieve safety and compliance. I'm here to\nDrummer proudly presents...\nMagidonia 24B v4.2.0 💿\nWhat's New?\nBetter roleplay\nCan think\nUsage\nMistral v7 Tekken\nTHINKING MODE (optional):\nUse <think> and </think> as the tokens with forced behavior. (Don't ask me why it's not [THINK])\nInclude the following at the end of the system prompt (adapted from the magistral model card):\nFirst draft your thinking process (inner monologue) until you arrive at a response. Format your response using Markdown, and use LaTeX for any mathematical equations. Write both your thoughts and the response in the same language as the input.\nYour thinking process must follow the template below:<think>Your thoughts or/and draft, like working through an exercise on scratch paper. Be as casual and as long as you want until you are confident to generate the response. Use the same language as the input.</think>Here, provide a self-contained response.\nDescription\nLinks\nOriginal: https://huggingface.co/TheDrummer/Magidonia-24B-v4.2.0\nGGUF: https://huggingface.co/TheDrummer/Magidonia-24B-v4.2.0-GGUF\niMatrix (recommended): https://huggingface.co/bartowski/TheDrummer_Magidonia-24B-v4.2.0-GGUF\nEXL3: https://huggingface.co/ArtusDev/TheDrummer_Magidonia-24B-v4.2.0-EXL3\nconfig-v4s",

TRM is a recursive reasoning approach that achieves amazing scores of 45% on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2 using a tiny 7M parameters neural network.\nPaper\nMotivation\nTiny Recursion Model (TRM) is a recursive reasoning model that achieves amazing scores of 45% on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2 with a tiny 7M parameters neural network. The idea that one must rely on massive foundational models trained for millions of dollars by some big corporation in order to achieve success on hard tasks is a trap. Currently, there is too much focus on exploiting LLMs rather than devising and expanding new lines of direction. With recursive reasoning, it turns out that “less is more”: you don’t always need to crank up model size in order for a model to reason and solve hard problems. A tiny model pretrained from scratch, recursing on itself and updating its answers over time, can achieve a lot without breaking the bank.\nThis work came to be after I learned about the recent innovative Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM). I was amazed that an approach using small models could do so well on hard tasks like the ARC-AGI competition (reaching 40% accuracy when normally only Large Language Models could compete). But I kept thinking that it is too complicated, relying too much on biological arguments about the human brain, and that this recursive reasoning process could be greatly simplified and improved. Tiny Recursion Model (TRM) simplifies recursive reasoning to its core essence, which ultimately has nothing to do with the human brain, does not require any mathematical (fixed-point) theorem, nor any hierarchy.\nHow TRM works\nTiny Recursion Model (TRM) recursively improves its predicted answer y with a tiny network. It starts with the embedded input question x and initial embedded answer y and latent z. For up to K improvements steps, it tries to improve its answer y. It does so by i) recursively updating n times its latent z given the question x, current answer y, and current latent z (recursive reasoning), and then ii) updating its answer y given the current answer y and current latent z. This recursive process allows the model to progressively improve its answer (potentially addressing any errors from its previous answer) in an extremely parameter-efficient manner while minimizing overfitting.\nRequirements\nPython 3.10 (or similar)\nCuda 12.6.0 (or similar)\npip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools\npip install --pre --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu126 # install torch based on your cuda version\npip install -r requirements.txt # install requirements\npip install --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation adam-atan2\nwandb login YOUR-LOGIN # login if you want the logger to sync results to your Weights & Biases (https://wandb.ai/)\nDataset Preparation\n# ARC-AGI-1\npython -m dataset.build_arc_dataset \\\n--input-file-prefix kaggle/combined/arc-agi \\\n--output-dir data/arc1concept-aug-1000 \\\n--subsets training evaluation concept \\\n--test-set-name evaluation\n# ARC-AGI-2\npython -m dataset.build_arc_dataset \\\n--input-file-prefix kaggle/combined/arc-agi \\\n--output-dir data/arc2concept-aug-1000 \\\n--subsets training2 evaluation2 concept \\\n--test-set-name evaluation2\n## Note: You cannot train on both ARC-AGI-1 and ARC-AGI-2 and evaluate them both because ARC-AGI-2 training data contains some ARC-AGI-1 eval data\n# Sudoku-Extreme\npython dataset/build_sudoku_dataset.py --output-dir data/sudoku-extreme-1k-aug-1000  --subsample-size 1000 --num-aug 1000  # 1000 examples, 1000 augments\n# Maze-Hard\npython dataset/build_maze_dataset.py # 1000 examples, 8 augments\nExperiments\nARC-AGI-1 (assuming 4 H-100 GPUs):\nrun_name=\"pretrain_att_arc1concept_4\"\ntorchrun --nproc-per-node 4 --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=localhost:0 --nnodes=1 pretrain.py \\\narch=trm \\\ndata_paths=\"[data/arc1concept-aug-1000]\" \\\narch.L_layers=2 \\\narch.H_cycles=3 arch.L_cycles=4 \\\n+run_name=${run_name} ema=True\nRuntime: ~3 days\nARC-AGI-2 (assuming 4 H-100 GPUs):\nrun_name=\"pretrain_att_arc2concept_4\"\ntorchrun --nproc-per-node 4 --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=localhost:0 --nnodes=1 pretrain.py \\\narch=trm \\\ndata_paths=\"[data/arc2concept-aug-1000]\" \\\narch.L_layers=2 \\\narch.H_cycles=3 arch.L_cycles=4 \\\n+run_name=${run_name} ema=True\nRuntime: ~3 days\nSudoku-Extreme (assuming 1 L40S GPU):\nrun_name=\"pretrain_mlp_t_sudoku\"\npython pretrain.py \\\narch=trm \\\ndata_paths=\"[data/sudoku-extreme-1k-aug-1000]\" \\\nevaluators=\"[]\" \\\nepochs=50000 eval_interval=5000 \\\nlr=1e-4 puzzle_emb_lr=1e-4 weight_decay=1.0 puzzle_emb_weight_decay=1.0 \\\narch.mlp_t=True arch.pos_encodings=none \\\narch.L_layers=2 \\\narch.H_cycles=3 arch.L_cycles=6 \\\n+run_name=${run_name} ema=True\nrun_name=\"pretrain_att_sudoku\"\npython pretrain.py \\\narch=trm \\\ndata_paths=\"[data/sudoku-extreme-1k-aug-1000]\" \\\nevaluators=\"[]\" \\\nepochs=50000 eval_interval=5000 \\\nlr=1e-4 puzzle_emb_lr=1e-4 weight_decay=1.0 puzzle_emb_weight_decay=1.0 \\\narch.L_layers=2 \\\narch.H_cycles=3 arch.L_cycles=6 \\\n+run_name=${run_name} ema=True\nRuntime: < 36 hours\nMaze-Hard (assuming 4 L40S GPUs):\nrun_name=\"pretrain_att_maze30x30\"\ntorchrun --nproc-per-node 4 --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=localhost:0 --nnodes=1 pretrain.py \\\narch=trm \\\ndata_paths=\"[data/maze-30x30-hard-1k]\" \\\nevaluators=\"[]\" \\\nepochs=50000 eval_interval=5000 \\\nlr=1e-4 puzzle_emb_lr=1e-4 weight_decay=1.0 puzzle_emb_weight_decay=1.0 \\\narch.L_layers=2 \\\narch.H_cycles=3 arch.L_cycles=4 \\\n+run_name=${run_name} ema=True\nRuntime: < 24 hours\nReference\nIf you find our work useful, please consider citing:\n@misc{jolicoeurmartineau2025morerecursivereasoningtiny,\ntitle={Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks},\nauthor={Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2510.04871},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.LG},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871},\n}\nand the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM):\n@misc{wang2025hierarchicalreasoningmodel,\ntitle={Hierarchical Reasoning Model},\nauthor={Guan Wang and Jin Li and Yuhao Sun and Xing Chen and Changling Liu and Yue Wu and Meng Lu and Sen Song and Yasin Abbasi Yadkori},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2506.21734},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.AI},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734},\n}\nThis code is based on the Hierarchical Reasoning Model code and the Hierarchical Reasoning Model Analysis code.",

But these models present problems for businesses seeking to include AI in their products.\nThey maintain control of the system prompt, deprecating and changing things as they wish, often causing software to break.\nThey maintain control of the model versions, sometimes changing things silently, or deprecating older models that your business relies on.\nThey maintain control of the alignment, and in particular the alignment is one-size-fits all, not tailored to the application.\nThey can see all your queries and they can potentially use that data in ways you wouldn't want.\nDolphin, in contrast, is steerable and gives control to the system owner. You set the system prompt.  You decide the alignment.  You have control of your data.  Dolphin does not impose its ethics or guidelines on you.  You are the one who decides the guidelines.\nDolphin belongs to YOU, it is your tool, an extension of your will.\nJust as you are personally responsible for what you do with a knife, gun, fire, car, or the internet, you are the creator and originator of any content you generate with Dolphin.\nhttps://erichartford.com/uncensored-models\nChat Template\nWe maintained the default Llama-3 chat template for this model.

Despite this need, existing medical AI systems disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at this https URL .\n📚 Introduction\nWe introduce UniMedVL, the unified medical foundation model for seamless multimodal understanding and generation. Four key innovations distinguish UniMedVL:\nUnified Observation-Knowledge-Analysis Architecture: UniMedVL sets itself apart from prior medical AI models by following a clinically-inspired three-level framework that mirrors how physicians process medical information, enabling both understanding and generation within a single architecture.\nVersatile Medical Multimodal Capabilities: UniMedVL supports a broad spectrum of medical tasks, including visual question answering, medical report generation, text-to-medical-image synthesis, cross-modal translation, and virtual staining across 9 imaging modalities.\nLarge-Scale Medical Dataset: We present UniMed-5M, a comprehensive medical multimodal dataset containing 5.6M+ high-quality samples with three-stage quality verification and expert validation, covering understanding, generation, and interleaved tasks.\nSuperior Performance: UniMedVL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation datasets, with 75.4% accuracy on SLAKE VQA, 53.5% on PathVQA, and competitive generation quality (96.29 average gFID), setting a new standard in unified medical AI.\n🔬 Methodology\n📋 OKA Framework: Observation-Knowledge-Analysis\nUniMedVL follows a workflow-guided three-level framework that mirrors how physicians process medical information:\nflowchart TD\nA[Observation Level] --> B[Knowledge Level] --> C[Analysis Level]\nA1[UniMed-5M Dataset<br/>5.6M samples<br/>8 imaging modalities] --> A\nA --> A2[Quality Control<br/>Three-stage verification<br/>Expert validation]\nB1[Progressive Curriculum<br/>Foundation → Instruction → Unified] --> B\nB --> B2[Cross-modal Knowledge Fusion<br/>Understanding ↔ Generation]\nC1[Unified Architecture<br/>Dual encoders + MOT] --> C\nC --> C2[Multimodal Outputs<br/>Reports + Images + Annotations]\n🎯 Training Strategy\nThree-Stage Progressive Curriculum Learning:\n🔧 Stage 1 - Foundation Training (85K steps)\nBasic medical pattern recognition\nVisual-language alignment\nData ratio: 75% I2T, 25% T2I\n📚 Stage 2 - Instruction Tuning (120K steps)\nCross-modal understanding enhancement\nMedical expertise development\nData ratio: 40% I2T, 45% T2I, 10% Interleaved\n🚀 Stage 3 - Unified Training (70K steps)\nAdvanced multimodal synthesis\nInterleaved task mastery\nData ratio: 37% I2T, 35% T2I, 25% Interleaved\nModel Details\nModel Description\nUniMedVL unifies medical multimodal understanding and generation within a single 14B-parameter architecture.

We first set up ExecuTorch:\ngit clone https://github.com/pytorch/executorch.git\npushd executorch\ngit checkout release/1.0\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\npython install_executorch.py\npopd\nExecuTorch's LLM export scripts require the checkpoint keys and parameters have certain names, which differ from those used in Hugging Face.\nSo we first use a script that converts the Hugging Face checkpoint key names to ones that ExecuTorch expects:\nThe following script does this for you.\npushd executorch\npython -m executorch.examples.models.qwen3.convert_weights $(hf download metascroy/Qwen3-4B-int8-int4-unsloth) pytorch_model_converted.bin\npopd\nOnce we have the checkpoint, we export it to ExecuTorch with a max_seq_length/max_context_length of 1024 to the XNNPACK backend as follows.\n(Note: ExecuTorch LLM export script requires config.json have certain key names.

SPEAR-VLM extends PaliGemma with the MoGe depth encoder and is trained on 3D VQA tasks using\nprimarily non-robot data sources, such as EgoExo-4D.\nSPEAR-1's architecture combines SPEAR-VLM with a DiT action expert. It is first pre-trained on a mixture of robot demonstration datasets from Open X Embodiment and\nthen fine-tuned for specific embodiments.\nUse with 🤗 Transformers\nWe provide a fully AutoModel compatible implementation of SPEAR-1 that can be used via transformers.\nEnvironment setup\nThe current implementation requires the following additional dependencies: roma, timm, flash-attn.\nHere is a snippet to set up a working environment for inference via uv:\nInstall uv:\nwget -qO- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.7.5/uv-installer.sh | sh\nCreate virtualenv and resolve the dependencies:\nuv venv python 3.10.12\nsource .venv/bin/activate\nuv pip install --torch-backend=cu126 roma==1.5.0 numpy==2.2.4 torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0 transformers==4.47.0 timm==1.0.15\nuv pip install --no-build-isolation setuptools psutil flash-attn==2.7.3\nExample usage\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import AutoModel\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"INSAIT-Institute/spear1-franka\")\nmodel = model.to(dtype=torch.bfloat16, device=\"cuda\").eval()\nmain_image = np.asarray(Image.open(\"path/to/main_image.png\"))\nwrist_image = np.asarray(Image.open(\"path/to/wrist_image.png\"))\nee_translation = np.array([0.36, 0.0, 0.56])\nee_rotation = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])\ngripper = np.array(1.0)\nmodel_input: Dict[str, np.ndarray | str | Dict[str, np.ndarray]] = {\n\"images\": {\n\"main\": main_image, # (H, W, C)\n\"wrist\": wrist_image, # (H, W, C)\n},\n\"ee_translation\": ee_translation, # (3,)\n\"ee_rotation\": ee_rotation, # (3, 3)\n\"gripper\": gripper, # (1,)\n\"language_instruction\": \"put the carrot on the blue plate\",\n\"dataset_name\": \"droid\"\n}\nmodel_output: Dict[str, np.ndarray] = model.predict_action(model_input)\nctrl_translation: np.ndarray = model_output[\"translation\"] # (S, 3)\nctrl_rotation: np.ndarray = model_output[\"rotation\"] # (S, 3, 3)\nctrl_gripper: np.ndarray = model_output[\"gripper\"] # (S, 1)\nAction space\nSPEAR-1 predicts action chunks of delta end-effector positions. Each step in the predicted action chunk is relative to the input state.\nGiven the current end-effector position [R, t] and a model prediction A_rel = [[R_1, t_1], ..., [R_n, t_n]], absolute end effector pose commands can be computed as:\nA_abs = [[R * R_1, t + t_1], ..., [R * R_n, t * t_n]]\nCommunity Feedback\nWe welcome feedback from the community to help improve SPEAR-1. If you have suggestions, encounter any issues, or have ideas for improvements, please contact us.\nSummary\nModel type: Vision-Language-Action with flow-matching action decoding\nContact: contact@insait.ai\nLicense: Gemma Terms of Use"
