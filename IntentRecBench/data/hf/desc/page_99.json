If you use Q4_0 and your hardware would benefit from repacking weights, it will do it automatically on the fly.\nAs of llama.cpp build b4282 you will not be able to run the Q4_0_X_X files and will instead need to use Q4_0.\nAdditionally, if you want to get slightly better quality for , you can use IQ4_NL thanks to this PR which will also repack the weights for ARM, though only the 4_4 for now. The loading time may be slower but it will result in an overall speed incrase.\nClick to view Q4_0_X_X information (deprecated\nI'm keeping this section to show the potential theoretical uplift in performance from using the Q4_0 with online repacking.\nClick to view benchmarks on an AVX2 system (EPYC7702)\nmodel\nsize\nparams\nbackend\nthreads\ntest\nt/s\n% (vs Q4_0)\nqwen2 3B Q4_0\n1.70 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\npp512\n204.03 ± 1.03\n100%\nqwen2 3B Q4_0\n1.70 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\npp1024\n282.92 ± 0.19\n100%\nqwen2 3B Q4_0\n1.70 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\npp2048\n259.49 ± 0.44\n100%\nqwen2 3B Q4_0\n1.70 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\ntg128\n39.12 ± 0.27\n100%\nqwen2 3B Q4_0\n1.70 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\ntg256\n39.31 ± 0.69\n100%\nqwen2 3B Q4_0\n1.70 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\ntg512\n40.52 ± 0.03\n100%\nqwen2 3B Q4_K_M\n1.79 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\npp512\n301.02 ± 1.74\n147%\nqwen2 3B Q4_K_M\n1.79 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\npp1024\n287.23 ± 0.20\n101%\nqwen2 3B Q4_K_M\n1.79 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\npp2048\n262.77 ± 1.81\n101%\nqwen2 3B Q4_K_M\n1.79 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\ntg128\n18.80 ± 0.99\n48%\nqwen2 3B Q4_K_M\n1.79 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\ntg256\n24.46 ± 3.04\n83%\nqwen2 3B Q4_K_M\n1.79 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\ntg512\n36.32 ± 3.59\n90%\nqwen2 3B Q4_0_8_8\n1.69 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\npp512\n271.71 ± 3.53\n133%\nqwen2 3B Q4_0_8_8\n1.69 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\npp1024\n279.86 ± 45.63\n100%\nqwen2 3B Q4_0_8_8\n1.69 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\npp2048\n320.77 ± 5.00\n124%\nqwen2 3B Q4_0_8_8\n1.69 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\ntg128\n43.51 ± 0.05\n111%\nqwen2 3B Q4_0_8_8\n1.69 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\ntg256\n43.35 ± 0.09\n110%\nqwen2 3B Q4_0_8_8\n1.69 GiB\n3.09 B\nCPU\n64\ntg512\n42.60 ± 0.31\n105%\nQ4_0_8_8 offers a nice bump to prompt processing and a small bump to text generation\nWhich file should I choose?\nClick here for details\nA great write up with charts showing various performances is provided by Artefact2 here\nThe first thing to figure out is how big a model you can run. To do this, you'll need to figure out how much RAM and/or VRAM you have.\nIf you want your model running as FAST as possible, you'll want to fit the whole thing on your GPU's VRAM. Aim for a quant with a file size 1-2GB smaller than your GPU's total VRAM.\nIf you want the absolute maximum quality, add both your system RAM and your GPU's VRAM together, then similarly grab a quant with a file size 1-2GB Smaller than that total.\nNext, you'll need to decide if you want to use an 'I-quant' or a 'K-quant'.\nIf you don't want to think too much, grab one of the K-quants. These are in format 'QX_K_X', like Q5_K_M.\nIf you want to get more into the weeds, you can check out this extremely useful feature chart:\nllama.cpp feature matrix\nBut basically, if you're aiming for below Q4, and you're running cuBLAS (Nvidia) or rocBLAS (AMD), you should look towards the I-quants. These are in format IQX_X, like IQ3_M. These are newer and offer better performance for their size.\nThese I-quants can also be used on CPU and Apple Metal, but will be slower than their K-quant equivalent, so speed vs performance is a tradeoff you'll have to decide.\nThe I-quants are not compatible with Vulcan, which is also AMD, so if you have an AMD card double check if you're using the rocBLAS build or the Vulcan build. At the time of writing this, LM Studio has a preview with ROCm support, and other inference engines have specific builds for ROCm.\nCredits\nThank you kalomaze and Dampf for assistance in creating the imatrix calibration dataset.\nThank you ZeroWw for the inspiration to experiment with embed/output.\nThank you to LM Studio for sponsoring my work.\nWant to support my work?

It used a series to tools to achieve that. It uses a combination of voice activity detection, speech recognition, language models, and text-to-speech synthesis to create a seamless and responsive conversational AI experience. The system is designed to run on-device, ensuring low latency and minimal data usage.\nHOW TO RUN IT\nPrerequisites:\nInstall Python 3.8+ (tested with 3.12)\nInstall eSpeak NG (required for voice synthesis)\nInstall Ollama from https://ollama.ai/\nSetup:\nClone the repository git clone https://github.com/asiff00/On-Device-Speech-to-Speech-Conversational-AI.git\nRun git lfs pull to download the models and voices\nCopy .env.template to .env\nAdd your HuggingFace token to .env\nTweak other parameters in .env, if needed [Optional]\nInstall requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt\nAdd any missing packages if not already installed pip install <package_name>\nRun Ollama:\nStart Ollama service\nRun: ollama run qwen2.5:0.5b-instruct-q8_0 or any other model of your choice\nStart Application:\nRun: python speech_to_speech.py\nWait for initialization (models loading)\nStart talking when you see \"Voice Chat Bot Ready\"\nLong press Ctrl+C to stop the application\nWe basically put a few models together to work in a multi-threaded architecture, where each component operates independently but is integrated through a queue management system to ensure performance and responsiveness.\nThe flow works as follows: Loop (VAD -> Whisper -> LM -> TextChunker -> TTS)\nTo achieve that we use:\nVoice Activity Detection: Pyannote:pyannote/segmentation-3.0\nSpeech Recognition: Whisper:whisper-tiny.en (OpenAI)\nLanguage Model: LM Studio/Ollama with qwen2.5:0.5b-instruct-q8_0\nVoice Synthesis: Kokoro:hexgrad/Kokoro-82M (Version 0.19, 16bit)\nWe use custom text processing and queues to manage data, with separate queues for text and audio. This setup allows the system to handle heavy tasks without slowing down. We also use an interrupt mechanism allowing the user to interrupt the AI at any time. This makes the conversation feel more natural and responsive rather than just a generic TTS engine.\nGitHub: https://github.com/asiff00/On-Device-Speech-to-Speech-Conversational-AI\nDemo Video:\nA demo video is uploaded here. Click on the thumbnail or the YouTube link: https://youtu.be/x92FLnwf-nA.\nPerformance:\nI ran this test on an AMD Ryzen 5600G, 16 GB, SSD, and No-GPU setup, achieving consistent ~2s latency. On average, it takes around 1.5s for the system to respond to a user query from the point the user says the last word. Although I haven't tested this on a GPU, I believe testing on a GPU would significantly improve performance and responsiveness.\nHow do we reduce latency?\nPriority based text chunking\nWe capitalize on the streaming output of the language model to reduce latency. Instead of waiting for the entire response to be generated, we process and deliver each chunk of text as soon as they become available, form phrases, and send it to the TTS engine queue. We play the audio as soon as it becomes available. This way, the user gets a very fast response, while the rest of the response is being generated.\nOur custom TextChunker analyzes incoming text streams from the language model and splits them into chunks suitable for the voice synthesizer. It uses a combination of sentence breaks (like periods, question marks, and exclamation points) and semantic breaks (like \"and\", \"but\", and \"however\") to determine the best places to split the text, ensuring natural-sounding speech output.\nThe TextChunker maintains a set of break points:\nSentence breaks: ., !, ? (highest priority)\nSemantic breaks with priority levels:\nLevel 4: however, therefore, furthermore, moreover, nevertheless\nLevel 3: while, although, unless, since\nLevel 2: and, but, because, then\nPunctuation breaks: ; (4), : (4), , (3), - (2)\nWhen processing text, the TextChunker uses a priority-based system:\nLooks for sentence-ending punctuation first (highest priority 5)\nChecks for semantic break words with their associated priority levels\nFalls back to punctuation marks with lower priorities\nSplits at target word count if no natural breaks are found\nThe text chunking method significantly reduces perceived latency by processing and delivering the first chunk of text as soon as it becomes available. Let's consider a hypothetical system where the language model generates responses at a certain rate. If we imagine a scenario where the model produces a response of N words at a rate of R words per second, waiting for the complete response would introduce a delay of N/R seconds before any audio is produced. With text chunking, the system can start processing the first M words as soon as they are ready (after M/R seconds), while the remaining words continue to be generated. This means the user hears the initial part of the response in just M/R seconds, while the rest streams in naturally.\nLeading filler word LLM Prompting\nWe use a another little trick in the LLM prompt to speed up the system’s first response. We ask the LLM to start its reply with filler words like “umm,” “so,” or “well.” These words have a special role in language: they create natural pauses and breaks. Since these are single-word responses, they take only milliseconds to convert to audio. When we apply our chunking rules, the system splits the response at the filler word (e.g., “umm,”) and sends that tiny chunk to the TTS engine. This lets the bot play the audio for “umm” almost instantly, reducing perceived latency. The filler words act as natural “bridges” to mask processing delays. Even a short “umm” gives the illusion of a fluid conversation, while the system works on generating the rest of the response in the background. Longer chunks after the filler word might take more time to process, but the initial pause feels intentional and human-like.\nWe have fallback plans for cases when the LLM fails to start its response with fillers. In those cases, we put hand breaks at 2 to 5 words, which comes with a cost of a bit of choppiness at the beginning but that feels less painful than the system taking a long time to give the first response.\nIn practice, this approach can reduce perceived latency by up to 50-70%, depending on the length of the response and the speed of the language model. For example, in a typical conversation where responses average 15-20 words, our techniques can bring the initial response time down from 1.5-2 seconds to just 0.5-0.7 seconds, making the interaction feel much more natural and immediate.\nResources\nThis project utilizes the following resources:\nText-to-Speech Model: Kokoro\nSpeech-to-Text Model: Whisper\nVoice Activity Detection Model: Pyannote\nLarge Language Model Server: Ollama\nFallback Text-to-Speech Engine: eSpeak NG\nAcknowledgements\nThis project draws inspiration and guidance from the following articles and repositories, among others:\nRealtime speech to speech conversation with MiniCPM-o\nA Comparative Guide to OpenAI and Ollama APIs\nBuilding Production-Ready TTS with Kokoro-82M\nKokoro-82M: The Best TTS Model in Just 82 Million Parameters\nStyleTTS2 Model Implementation",

Udlejeren skal dog ikke foretage lejenedsættelse, hvis bortfald eller nedsættelse af skatter, afgifter, udgifter og bidrag samtidig udlignes eller overstiges af nye forøgede skatter, afgifter, udgifter eller bidrag. I fredede ejendomme, hvorpå der er tinglyst en særlig bevaringsdeklaration i henhold til lovgivningen om bygningsfredning, kan et beløb svarende til den ejendomsskat, der til enhver tid kunne have været opkrævet, dog opkræves som en del af lejen, uanset om en ejendom er fritaget for ejendomsbeskatning.  Stk. 2. Udlejeren skal give lejeren skriftlig meddelelse om nedsættelsen af lejen, senest 6 uger efter at meddelelsen om nedsættelsen af skatter, afgifter, udgifter eller bidrag er kommet frem.\\n',\n'Lov om boligforhold (Fondens udførelse af vedligeholdelses- og forbedringsarbejder):    § 69. Har en udlejer ikke udført vedligeholdelses- og forbedringsarbejder inden en af huslejenævnet fastsat frist, jf. § 108, stk. 2, § 114, stk. 2, og § 147, stk. 3, i lov om leje, kan investeringsfonden på begæring af en lejer lade de nævnte arbejder udføre for udlejerens regning, uanset om udlejeren har indbragt huslejenævnets afgørelse for domstolene. Investeringsfonden kan tinglyse meddelelse herom på ejendommen og lade den aflyse, når arbejderne er udført og fonden har fået dækning for sine udlæg.  Stk. 2. Bestrider udlejeren, at investeringsfonden har været berettiget til at udføre arbejderne, eller udgifternes rimelighed, kan udlejeren deponere beløbet eller efter aftale med fonden stille sikkerhed for beløbets betaling.  Stk. 3. Efter at have foretaget deponering eller stillet sikkerhed, jf. stk. 2, har udlejeren pligt til at anlægge sag ved retten med henblik på afklaring af spørgsmålet om, hvorvidt Grundejernes Investeringsfond har været berettiget til at udføre de omtvistede arbejder, jf. stk. 1. Har udlejeren ikke anlagt sag inden for 12 måneder fra deponeringstidspunktet eller tidspunktet for sikkerhedsstillelsen, skal de deponerede midler eller den stillede sikkerhed frigives til Grundejernes Investeringsfond.  Stk. 4. Forrentning af beløb, som fonden har lagt ud, fastsættes af fonden med en rente, der svarer til den effektive rente for et 30-årigt kontant annuitetslån i et godkendt realkreditinstitut.  Stk. 5. Såfremt udlejeren ikke deponerer eller stiller sikkerhed efter stk. 2, kan fonden til dækning af udgifterne ved arbejdernes udførelse yde udlejeren et lån og som sikkerhed for lånet lade tinglyse pant i ejendommen med fortrinsret efter ejendomsskatter, men uden personlig hæftelse. Lånet udbetales kontant og forrentes med en rentesats, der fastsættes af fonden, og som ved lånets optagelse svarer til forrentningen efter stk. 4. Afdragstiden fastsættes til højst 10 år. Dette gælder også for udgifter til dækning af forundersøgelser og lign., som er nødvendige for fondens beslutning efter stk. 1. Fonden kan opkræve et administrationsbidrag svarende til, hvad der opkræves for realkredit som nævnt i stk. 4. Grundejernes Investeringsfond skal på begæring af en ejendoms administrator efter kapitel 5 udlevere materiale vedrørende ejendommen. Investeringsfonden kan kræve betaling til dækning af den udgift, der med rimelighed er afholdt til tilvejebringelse af dette materiale.  Stk. 6. Investeringsfonden kan i øvrigt bestemme, at indtil 50 pct. af lejeindtægten skal indbetales til fonden, indtil fonden har fået dækning for sine udlæg med påløbne omkostninger og renter. Investeringsfonden skal lade beslutningen, der er gyldig mod enhver, tinglyse på ejendommen.  Stk. 7. Såfremt investeringsfonden efter stk. 6 kan oppebære en del af lejeindtægten, skal alle lejerne efter påkrav herom betale lejen til investeringsfonden, som refunderer udlejeren overskydende beløb. Kun betaling til investeringsfonden har frigørende virkning.  Stk. 8. Nærmere regler om fondens adgang til at kræve gebyr for administration i forbindelse med arbejdernes udførelse fastsættes af indenrigs- og boligministeren.\\n',\n]\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings.shape)\n# [3, 768]\n# Get the similarity scores for the embeddings\nsimilarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)\nprint(similarities.shape)\n# [3, 3]\nEvaluation\nMetrics\nTriplet\nDatasets: danish_law-validator and ai-job-test\nEvaluated with TripletEvaluator\nMetric\ndanish_law-validator\nai-job-test\ncosine_accuracy\n0.9733\n0.9719\nTraining Details\nTraining Dataset\ndanish_law_qa\nDataset: danish_law_qa at 075eed8\nSize: 18,715 training samples\nColumns: question, context, and neg_context\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\nquestion\ncontext\nneg_context\ntype\nstring\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 2 tokensmean: 31.41 tokensmax: 80 tokens\nmin: 54 tokensmean: 413.02 tokensmax: 512 tokens\nmin: 19 tokensmean: 413.2 tokensmax: 512 tokens\nSamples:\nquestion\ncontext\nneg_context\nHvad skal fremgå af en lejeaftale hvis udlejeren ønsker at opkræve en leje baseret på § 25, stk. 2\nLov om leje (Lejeaftalens udformning og indhold):    § 11.

    "Zyphra/Zonos-v0.1-transformer": "Zonos-v0.1\nUsage\nPython\nGradio interface (recommended)\nFeatures\nInstallation\nDocker installation\nCitation\nZonos-v0.1\nZonos-v0.1 is a leading open-weight text-to-speech model trained on more than 200k hours of varied multilingual speech, delivering expressiveness and quality on par with—or even surpassing—top TTS providers.\nOur model enables highly natural speech generation from text prompts when given a speaker embedding or audio prefix, and can accurately perform speech cloning when given a reference clip spanning just a few seconds. The conditioning setup also allows for fine control over speaking rate, pitch variation, audio quality, and emotions such as happiness, fear, sadness, and anger. The model outputs speech natively at 44kHz.\nFor more details and speech samples, check out our blog here\nWe also have a hosted version available at playground.zyphra.com/audio\nZonos follows a straightforward architecture: text normalization and phonemization via eSpeak, followed by DAC token prediction through a transformer or hybrid backbone. An overview of the architecture can be seen below.\nUsage\nPython\nimport torch\nimport torchaudio\nfrom zonos.model import Zonos\nfrom zonos.conditioning import make_cond_dict\n# model = Zonos.from_pretrained(\"Zyphra/Zonos-v0.1-hybrid\", device=\"cuda\")\nmodel = Zonos.from_pretrained(\"Zyphra/Zonos-v0.1-transformer\", device=\"cuda\")\nwav, sampling_rate = torchaudio.load(\"assets/exampleaudio.mp3\")\nspeaker = model.make_speaker_embedding(wav, sampling_rate)\ncond_dict = make_cond_dict(text=\"Hello, world!\", speaker=speaker, language=\"en-us\")\nconditioning = model.prepare_conditioning(cond_dict)\ncodes = model.generate(conditioning)\nwavs = model.autoencoder.decode(codes).cpu()\ntorchaudio.save(\"sample.wav\", wavs[0], model.autoencoder.sampling_rate)\nGradio interface (recommended)\nuv run gradio_interface.py\n# python gradio_interface.py\nThis should produce a sample.wav file in your project root directory.\nFor repeated sampling we highly recommend using the gradio interface instead, as the minimal example needs to load the model every time it is run.\nFeatures\nZero-shot TTS with voice cloning: Input desired text and a 10-30s speaker sample to generate high quality TTS output\nAudio prefix inputs: Add text plus an audio prefix for even richer speaker matching. Audio prefixes can be used to elicit behaviours such as whispering which can otherwise be challenging to replicate when cloning from speaker embeddings\nMultilingual support: Zonos-v0.1 supports English, Japanese, Chinese, French, and German\nAudio quality and emotion control: Zonos offers fine-grained control of many aspects of the generated audio. These include speaking rate, pitch, maximum frequency, audio quality, and various emotions such as happiness, anger, sadness, and fear.\nFast: our model runs with a real-time factor of ~2x on an RTX 4090\nGradio WebUI: Zonos comes packaged with an easy to use gradio interface to generate speech\nSimple installation and deployment: Zonos can be installed and deployed simply using the docker file packaged with our repository.\nInstallation\nAt the moment this repository only supports Linux systems (preferably Ubuntu 22.04/24.04) with recent NVIDIA GPUs (3000-series or newer, 6GB+ VRAM).\nSee also Docker Installation\nSystem dependencies\nZonos depends on the eSpeak library phonemization. You can install it on Ubuntu with the following command:\napt install -y espeak-ng\nPython dependencies\nWe highly recommend using a recent version of uv for installation. If you don't have uv installed, you can install it via pip: pip install -U uv.\nInstalling into a new uv virtual environment (recommended)\nuv sync\nuv sync --extra compile\nInstalling into the system/actived environment using uv\nuv pip install -e .\nuv pip install -e .[compile]\nInstalling into the system/actived environment using pip\npip install -e .\npip install --no-build-isolation -e .[compile]\nConfirm that it's working\nFor convenience we provide a minimal example to check that the installation works:\nuv run sample.py\n# python sample.py\nDocker installation\ngit clone https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos.git\ncd Zonos\n# For gradio\ndocker compose up\n# Or for development you can do\ndocker build -t Zonos .\ndocker run -it --gpus=all --net=host -v /path/to/Zonos:/Zonos -t Zonos\ncd /Zonos\npython sample.py # this will generate a sample.wav in /Zonos\nCitation\nIf you find this model useful in an academic context please cite as:\n@misc{zyphra2025zonos,\ntitle     = {Zonos-v0.1: An Expressive, Open-Source TTS Model},\nauthor    = {Dario Sucic, Mohamed Osman, Gabriel Clark, Chris Warner, Beren Millidge},\nyear      = {2025},\n}",

To better capture the rich morphological features of Kazakh, we extend the base vocabulary by 25% with high-frequency Kazakh tokens. This expansion reduces tokenization fertility (i.e., the average number of subwords per word) and improves both training and inference efficiency.\nTraining Data\nSherkala is continually pre-trained on 45.3 billion tokens from a diverse range of sources covering Kazakh and English with the addition of Russian and Turkish to enable better performance in Kazakh via cross-lingual transfer of capabilities.\nPretraining data is preprocessed using standard techniques including language-specific standardization, filtering, cleaning, and deduplication using locality-sensitive hashing.\nTo enable robust instruction following and safe dialog generation, Sherkala is fine-tuned on a large-scale multilingual instruction dataset comprising of Kazakh, English, and Russian prompt-response examples.\nThe instruction dataset includes a wide coverage of general tasks and capabilities in all 3 languages.\nA dedicated safety dataset—created using a mix of direct and adversarial prompts—is incorporated to mitigate harmful or biased outputs and to ensure cultural alignment.\nMore information can be found in the Sherkala Technical Report.\nTraining Details\nTraining Hyperparameters\nLearning rate: 1.5e-4\nBatch size: 4 million tokens\nOptimizer: AdamW (β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, ε = 1e-5)\nWeight decay: 0.1\nGradient norm clipping: 1.0\nLearning rate schedule:\nLinear warm-up (110 steps)\n10× cosine decay until 11,433 steps\nTraining Infrastructure\nTraining process was performed on the Cerebras Condor Galaxy 2 (CG-2) AI supercomputer\nTraining executed on 16 Cerebras CS-2 systems\nParallelism: Pure data parallelism across multiple CS-2 systems.\nEvaluation\nSherkala has been extensively evaluated across downstream tasks, open-ended generation, and safety metrics.

It excels at tasks related to the nuances of the Turkish language, such as grammatical error correction and text summarization.\nTokenizer Efficiency\nKumru tokenizer is a modern BPE tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 50,176, pre-tokenization regex and a chat template.\nOther open-source models spend between 38% to 98% more tokens than Kumru while still having larger vocabulary sizes.\nThis means Kumru can represent more texts in its context length and process faster and cheaper. Although the native context length of Kumru is 8,192, its effective context length can be considered between 1128 and 1618, compared to other multilingual models out there.\nThis shows the efficiency of having a native Turkish tokenizer in terms of representation power, speed and cost.\nCitation\n@misc{turker2025kumru,\ntitle={Kumru},\nauthor={Turker, Meliksah and Ari, Erdi and Han, Aydin},\nyear={2025},\nurl={https://huggingface.co/vngrs-ai/Kumru-2B-Base}\n}",
