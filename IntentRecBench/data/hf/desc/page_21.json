Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1.\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.\nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n3.

Hmm, where do I even start? I remember from school that adding numbers is pretty basic, but I want to make sure I understand it properly.\nLet me think, 1 plus 1. So, I have one item and I add another one. Maybe like a apple plus another apple. If I have one apple and someone gives me another, I now have two apples. So, 1 plus 1 should be 2. That makes sense.\nWait, but sometimes math can be tricky. Could it be something else? Like, in a different number system maybe? But I think the question is straightforward, using regular numbers, not like binary or hexadecimal or anything.\nI also recall that in arithmetic, addition is combining quantities. So, if you have two quantities of 1, combining them gives you a total of 2. Yeah, that seems right.\nIs there a scenario where 1 plus 1 wouldn't be 2? I can't think of any...\nIf you have a GPU (RTX 4090 for example) with 24GB, you can offload multiple layers to the GPU for faster processing.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1.\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.\nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n3.

    "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M": "Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M\nIntroduction\nRequirements\nQuickstart\nProcessing Ultra Long Texts\nEvaluation & Performance\nCitation\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M\nIntroduction\nQwen2.5-1M is the long-context version of the Qwen2.5 series models, supporting a context length of up to 1M tokens. Compared to the Qwen2.5 128K version, Qwen2.5-1M demonstrates significantly improved performance in handling long-context tasks while maintaining its capability in short tasks.\nThe model has the following features:\nType: Causal Language Models\nTraining Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\nArchitecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias\nNumber of Parameters: 7.61B\nNumber of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 6.53B\nNumber of Layers: 28\nNumber of Attention Heads (GQA): 28 for Q and 4 for KV\nContext Length: Full 1,010,000 tokens and generation 8192 tokens\nWe recommend deploying with our custom vLLM, which introduces sparse attention and length extrapolation methods to ensure efficiency and accuracy for long-context tasks. For specific guidance, refer to this section.\nYou can also use the previous framework that supports Qwen2.5 for inference, but accuracy degradation may occur for sequences exceeding 262,144 tokens.\nFor more details, please refer to our blog, GitHub, Technical Report, and Documentation.\nRequirements\nThe code of Qwen2.5 has been in the latest Hugging face transformers and we advise you to use the latest version of transformers.\nWith transformers<4.37.0, you will encounter the following error:\nKeyError: 'qwen2'\nQuickstart\nHere provides a code snippet with apply_chat_template to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M\"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_name,\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nprompt = \"Give me a short introduction to large language model.\"\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

This approach significantly improves model generation performance for sequences exceeding 256K tokens and achieves a 3 to 7 times speedup for sequences up to 1M tokens.\nHere we provide step-by-step instructions for deploying the Qwen2.5-1M models with our framework.\n1. System Preparation\nTo achieve the best performance, we recommend using GPUs with Ampere or Hopper architecture, which support optimized kernels.\nEnsure your system meets the following requirements:\nCUDA Version: 12.1 or 12.3\nPython Version: >=3.9 and <=3.12\nVRAM Requirements:\nFor processing 1 million-token sequences:\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M: At least 120GB VRAM (total across GPUs).\nQwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M: At least 320GB VRAM (total across GPUs).\nIf your GPUs do not have sufficient VRAM, you can still use Qwen2.5-1M for shorter tasks.\n2. Install Dependencies\nFor now, you need to clone the vLLM repository from our custom branch and install it manually. We are working on getting our branch merged into the main vLLM project.\ngit clone -b dev/dual-chunk-attn git@github.com:QwenLM/vllm.git\ncd vllm\npip install -e . -v\n3.

Consider reducing the max_model_len or increasing the tensor_parallel_size. Alternatively, you can reduce max_num_batched_tokens, although this may significantly slow down inference.\nEncountering the error: \"torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory.\"\nThe VRAM reserved for activation weights is insufficient.

During this period, we focused on building more useful vision-language models. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Qwen family: Qwen2.5-VL.\nKey Enhancements:\nUnderstand things visually: Qwen2.5-VL is not only proficient in recognizing common objects such as flowers, birds, fish, and insects, but it is highly capable of analyzing texts, charts, icons, graphics, and layouts within images.\nBeing agentic: Qwen2.5-VL directly plays as a visual agent that can reason and dynamically direct tools, which is capable of computer use and phone use.\nUnderstanding long videos and capturing events: Qwen2.5-VL can comprehend videos of over 1 hour, and this time it has a new ability of cpaturing event by pinpointing the relevant video segments.\nCapable of visual localization in different formats: Qwen2.5-VL can accurately localize objects in an image by generating bounding boxes or points, and it can provide stable JSON outputs for coordinates and attributes.\nGenerating structured outputs: for data like scans of invoices, forms, tables, etc. Qwen2.5-VL supports structured outputs of their contents, benefiting usages in finance, commerce, etc.\nModel Architecture Updates:\nDynamic Resolution and Frame Rate Training for Video Understanding:\nWe extend dynamic resolution to the temporal dimension by adopting dynamic FPS sampling, enabling the model to comprehend videos at various sampling rates. Accordingly, we update mRoPE in the time dimension with IDs and absolute time alignment, enabling the model to learn temporal sequence and speed, and ultimately acquire the ability to pinpoint specific moments.\nStreamlined and Efficient Vision Encoder\nWe enhance both training and inference speeds by strategically implementing window attention into the ViT. The ViT architecture is further optimized with SwiGLU and RMSNorm, aligning it with the structure of the Qwen2.5 LLM.\nWe have three models with 3, 7 and 72 billion parameters. This repo contains the instruction-tuned 72B Qwen2.5-VL model.

By default, it uses the native resolution for input, but higher resolutions can enhance performance at the cost of more computation. Users can set the minimum and maximum number of pixels to achieve an optimal configuration for their needs, such as a token count range of 256-1280, to balance speed and memory usage.\nmin_pixels = 256 * 28 * 28\nmax_pixels = 1280 * 28 * 28\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\n\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct\", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels\n)\nBesides, We provide two methods for fine-grained control over the image size input to the model:\nDefine min_pixels and max_pixels: Images will be resized to maintain their aspect ratio within the range of min_pixels and max_pixels.\nSpecify exact dimensions: Directly set resized_height and resized_width. These values will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 28.\n# min_pixels and max_pixels\nmessages = [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"image\",\n\"image\": \"file:///path/to/your/image.jpg\",\n\"resized_height\": 280,\n\"resized_width\": 420,\n},\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image.\"},\n],\n}\n]\n# resized_height and resized_width\nmessages = [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"image\",\n\"image\": \"file:///path/to/your/image.jpg\",\n\"min_pixels\": 50176,\n\"max_pixels\": 50176,\n},\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image.\"},\n],\n}\n]\nProcessing Long Texts\nThe current config.json is set for context length up to 32,768 tokens.\nTo handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize YaRN, a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts.\nFor supported frameworks, you could add the following to config.json to enable YaRN:\n{\n...,\n\"type\": \"yarn\",\n\"mrope_section\": [\n16,\n24,\n24\n],\n\"factor\": 4,\n\"original_max_position_embeddings\": 32768\n}\nHowever, it should be noted that this method has a significant impact on the performance of temporal and spatial localization tasks, and is therefore not recommended for use.\nAt the same time, for long video inputs, since MRoPE itself is more economical with ids, the max_position_embeddings can be directly modified to a larger value, such as 64k.\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n@misc{qwen2.5-VL,\ntitle = {Qwen2.5-VL},\nurl = {https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl/},\nauthor = {Qwen Team},\nmonth = {January},\nyear = {2025}\n}\n@article{Qwen2VL,\ntitle={Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model's Perception of the World at Any Resolution},\nauthor={Wang, Peng and Bai, Shuai and Tan, Sinan and Wang, Shijie and Fan, Zhihao and Bai, Jinze and Chen, Keqin and Liu, Xuejing and Wang, Jialin and Ge, Wenbin and Fan, Yang and Dang, Kai and Du, Mengfei and Ren, Xuancheng and Men, Rui and Liu, Dayiheng and Zhou, Chang and Zhou, Jingren and Lin, Junyang},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.12191},\nyear={2024}\n}\n@article{Qwen-VL,\ntitle={Qwen-VL: A Versatile Vision-Language Model for Understanding, Localization, Text Reading, and Beyond},\nauthor={Bai, Jinze and Bai, Shuai and Yang, Shusheng and Wang, Shijie and Tan, Sinan and Wang, Peng and Lin, Junyang and Zhou, Chang and Zhou, Jingren},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.12966},\nyear={2023}\n}",

Gemma 3 has a large, 128K context window, multilingual support in over\n140 languages, and is available in more sizes than previous versions. Gemma 3\nmodels are well-suited for a variety of text generation and image understanding\ntasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their\nrelatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with\nlimited resources such as laptops, desktops or your own cloud infrastructure,\ndemocratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation\nfor everyone.\nInputs and outputs\nInput:\nText string, such as a question, a prompt, or a document to be summarized\nImages, normalized to 896 x 896 resolution and encoded to 256 tokens\neach\nTotal input context of 128K tokens for the 4B, 12B, and 27B sizes, and\n32K tokens for the 1B size\nOutput:\nGenerated text in response to the input, such as an answer to a\nquestion, analysis of image content, or a summary of a document\nTotal output context of 8192 tokens\nUsage\nBelow, there are some code snippets on how to get quickly started with running the model.

The 27B model was trained with 14 trillion tokens, the 12B model was\ntrained with 12 trillion tokens, 4B model was trained with 4 trillion tokens and\n1B with 2 trillion tokens. Here are the key components:\nWeb Documents: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is\nexposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. The\ntraining dataset includes content in over 140 languages.\nCode: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and\npatterns of programming languages, which improves its ability to generate\ncode and understand code-related questions.\nMathematics: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn logical\nreasoning, symbolic representation, and to address mathematical queries.\nImages: A wide range of images enables the model to perform image\nanalysis and visual data extraction tasks.\nThe combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful\nmultimodal model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and data\nformats.\nData Preprocessing\nHere are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training\ndata:\nCSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering\nwas applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure\nthe exclusion of harmful and illegal content.\nSensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models\nsafe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain\npersonal information and other sensitive data from training sets.\nAdditional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in\nline with our policies.\nImplementation Information\nDetails about the model internals.\nHardware\nGemma was trained using Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware (TPUv4p,\nTPUv5p and TPUv5e). Training vision-language models (VLMS) requires significant\ncomputational power. TPUs, designed specifically for matrix operations common in\nmachine learning, offer several advantages in this domain:\nPerformance: TPUs are specifically designed to handle the massive\ncomputations involved in training VLMs. They can speed up training\nconsiderably compared to CPUs.\nMemory: TPUs often come with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,\nallowing for the handling of large models and batch sizes during training.\nThis can lead to better model quality.\nScalability: TPU Pods (large clusters of TPUs) provide a scalable\nsolution for handling the growing complexity of large foundation models.\nYou can distribute training across multiple TPU devices for faster and more\nefficient processing.\nCost-effectiveness: In many scenarios, TPUs can provide a more\ncost-effective solution for training large models compared to CPU-based\ninfrastructure, especially when considering the time and resources saved\ndue to faster training.\nThese advantages are aligned with\nGoogle's commitments to operate sustainably.\nSoftware\nTraining was done using JAX and ML Pathways.\nJAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,\nincluding TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models. ML\nPathways is Google's latest effort to build artificially intelligent systems\ncapable of generalizing across multiple tasks. This is specially suitable for\nfoundation models, including large language models like these ones.\nTogether, JAX and ML Pathways are used as described in the\npaper about the Gemini family of models; \"the 'single\ncontroller' programming model of Jax and Pathways allows a single Python\nprocess to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying the\ndevelopment workflow.\"\nEvaluation\nModel evaluation metrics and results.\nBenchmark Results\nThese models were evaluated against a large collection of different datasets and\nmetrics to cover different aspects of text generation:\nReasoning and factuality\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 3 PT 1B\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nHellaSwag\n10-shot\n62.3\n77.2\n84.2\n85.6\nBoolQ\n0-shot\n63.2\n72.3\n78.8\n82.4\nPIQA\n0-shot\n73.8\n79.6\n81.8\n83.3\nSocialIQA\n0-shot\n48.9\n51.9\n53.4\n54.9\nTriviaQA\n5-shot\n39.8\n65.8\n78.2\n85.5\nNatural Questions\n5-shot\n9.48\n20.0\n31.4\n36.1\nARC-c\n25-shot\n38.4\n56.2\n68.9\n70.6\nARC-e\n0-shot\n73.0\n82.4\n88.3\n89.0\nWinoGrande\n5-shot\n58.2\n64.7\n74.3\n78.8\nBIG-Bench Hard\nfew-shot\n28.4\n50.9\n72.6\n77.7\nDROP\n1-shot\n42.4\n60.1\n72.2\n77.2\nSTEM and code\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nMMLU\n5-shot\n59.6\n74.5\n78.6\nMMLU (Pro COT)\n5-shot\n29.2\n45.3\n52.2\nAGIEval\n3-5-shot\n42.1\n57.4\n66.2\nMATH\n4-shot\n24.2\n43.3\n50.0\nGSM8K\n8-shot\n38.4\n71.0\n82.6\nGPQA\n5-shot\n15.0\n25.4\n24.3\nMBPP\n3-shot\n46.0\n60.4\n65.6\nHumanEval\n0-shot\n36.0\n45.7\n48.8\nMultilingual\nBenchmark\nGemma 3 PT 1B\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nMGSM\n2.04\n34.7\n64.3\n74.3\nGlobal-MMLU-Lite\n24.9\n57.0\n69.4\n75.7\nWMT24++ (ChrF)\n36.7\n48.4\n53.9\n55.7\nFloRes\n29.5\n39.2\n46.0\n48.8\nXQuAD (all)\n43.9\n68.0\n74.5\n76.8\nECLeKTic\n4.69\n11.0\n17.2\n24.4\nIndicGenBench\n41.4\n57.2\n61.7\n63.4\nMultimodal\nBenchmark\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nCOCOcap\n102\n111\n116\nDocVQA (val)\n72.8\n82.3\n85.6\nInfoVQA (val)\n44.1\n54.8\n59.4\nMMMU (pt)\n39.2\n50.3\n56.1\nTextVQA (val)\n58.9\n66.5\n68.6\nRealWorldQA\n45.5\n52.2\n53.9\nReMI\n27.3\n38.5\n44.8\nAI2D\n63.2\n75.2\n79.0\nChartQA\n63.6\n74.7\n76.3\nVQAv2\n63.9\n71.2\n72.9\nBLINK\n38.0\n35.9\n39.6\nOKVQA\n51.0\n58.7\n60.2\nTallyQA\n42.5\n51.8\n54.3\nSpatialSense VQA\n50.9\n60.0\n59.4\nCountBenchQA\n26.1\n17.8\n68.0\nEthics and Safety\nEthics and safety evaluation approach and results.\nEvaluation Approach\nOur evaluation methods include structured evaluations and internal red-teaming\ntesting of relevant content policies. Red-teaming was conducted by a number of\ndifferent teams, each with different goals and human evaluation metrics. These\nmodels were evaluated against a number of different categories relevant to\nethics and safety, including:\nChild Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\ncovering child safety policies, including child sexual abuse and\nexploitation.\nContent Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\ncovering safety policies including, harassment, violence and gore, and hate\nspeech.\nRepresentational Harms: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text\nprompts covering safety policies including bias, stereotyping, and harmful\nassociations or inaccuracies.\nIn addition to development level evaluations, we conduct \"assurance\nevaluations\" which are our 'arms-length' internal evaluations for responsibility\ngovernance decision making. They are conducted separately from the model\ndevelopment team, to inform decision making about release. High level findings\nare fed back to the model team, but prompt sets are held-out to prevent\noverfitting and preserve the results' ability to inform decision making.\nAssurance evaluation results are reported to our Responsibility & Safety Council\nas part of release review.\nEvaluation Results\nFor all areas of safety testing, we saw major improvements in the categories of\nchild safety, content safety, and representational harms relative to previous\nGemma models. All testing was conducted without safety filters to evaluate the\nmodel capabilities and behaviors. For both text-to-text and image-to-text, and\nacross all model sizes, the model produced minimal policy violations, and showed\nsignificant improvements over previous Gemma models' performance with respect\nto ungrounded inferences. A limitation of our evaluations was they included only\nEnglish language prompts.\nUsage and Limitations\nThese models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.\nIntended Usage\nOpen vision-language models (VLMs) models have a wide range of applications\nacross various industries and domains. The following list of potential uses is\nnot comprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development.\nContent Creation and Communication\nText Generation: These models can be used to generate creative text\nformats such as poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.\nChatbots and Conversational AI: Power conversational interfaces\nfor customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.\nText Summarization: Generate concise summaries of a text corpus,\nresearch papers, or reports.\nImage Data Extraction: These models can be used to extract,\ninterpret, and summarize visual data for text communications.\nResearch and Education\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and VLM Research: These\nmodels can serve as a foundation for researchers to experiment with VLM\nand NLP techniques, develop algorithms, and contribute to the\nadvancement of the field.\nLanguage Learning Tools: Support interactive language learning\nexperiences, aiding in grammar correction or providing writing practice.\nKnowledge Exploration: Assist researchers in exploring large\nbodies of text by generating summaries or answering questions about\nspecific topics.\nLimitations\nTraining Data\nThe quality and diversity of the training data significantly\ninfluence the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data\ncan lead to limitations in the model's responses.\nThe scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas\nthe model can handle effectively.\nContext and Task Complexity\nModels are better at tasks that can be framed with clear\nprompts and instructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be\nchallenging.\nA model's performance can be influenced by the amount of context\nprovided (longer context generally leads to better outputs, up to a\ncertain point).\nLanguage Ambiguity and Nuance\nNatural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle\nto grasp subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\nFactual Accuracy\nModels generate responses based on information they learned\nfrom their training datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They\nmay generate incorrect or outdated factual statements.\nCommon Sense\nModels rely on statistical patterns in language. They might\nlack the ability to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.\nEthical Considerations and Risks\nThe development of vision-language models (VLMs) raises several ethical\nconcerns. In creating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:\nBias and Fairness\nVLMs trained on large-scale, real-world text and image data can\nreflect socio-cultural biases embedded in the training material. These\nmodels underwent careful scrutiny, input data pre-processing described\nand posterior evaluations reported in this card.\nMisinformation and Misuse\nVLMs can be misused to generate text that is false, misleading,\nor harmful.\nGuidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the\nResponsible Generative AI Toolkit.\nTransparency and Accountability:\nThis model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,\ncapabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.\nA responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to\nshare innovation by making VLM technology accessible to developers and\nresearchers across the AI ecosystem.\nRisks identified and mitigations:\nPerpetuation of biases: It's encouraged to perform continuous\nmonitoring (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of\nde-biasing techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use\ncases.\nGeneration of harmful content: Mechanisms and guidelines for content\nsafety are essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and\nimplement appropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific\nproduct policies and application use cases.\nMisuse for malicious purposes: Technical limitations and developer\nand end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of\nVLMs. Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag\nmisuse are provided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the\nGemma Prohibited Use Policy.\nPrivacy violations: Models were trained on data filtered for removal\nof certain personal information and other sensitive data. Developers are\nencouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving\ntechniques.\nBenefits\nAt the time of release, this family of models provides high-performance open\nvision-language model implementations designed from the ground up for\nresponsible AI development compared to similarly sized models.\nUsing the benchmark evaluation metrics described in this document, these models\nhave shown to provide superior performance to other, comparably-sized open model\nalternatives.",

Gemma 3 has a large, 128K context window, multilingual support in over\n140 languages, and is available in more sizes than previous versions. Gemma 3\nmodels are well-suited for a variety of text generation and image understanding\ntasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning.

The 27B model was trained with 14 trillion tokens, the 12B model was\ntrained with 12 trillion tokens, 4B model was trained with 4 trillion tokens and\n1B with 2 trillion tokens. Here are the key components:\nWeb Documents: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is\nexposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. The\ntraining dataset includes content in over 140 languages.\nCode: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and\npatterns of programming languages, which improves its ability to generate\ncode and understand code-related questions.\nMathematics: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn logical\nreasoning, symbolic representation, and to address mathematical queries.\nImages: A wide range of images enables the model to perform image\nanalysis and visual data extraction tasks.\nThe combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful\nmultimodal model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and data\nformats.\nData Preprocessing\nHere are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training\ndata:\nCSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering\nwas applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure\nthe exclusion of harmful and illegal content.\nSensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models\nsafe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain\npersonal information and other sensitive data from training sets.\nAdditional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in\nline with our policies.\nImplementation Information\nDetails about the model internals.\nHardware\nGemma was trained using Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware (TPUv4p,\nTPUv5p and TPUv5e). Training vision-language models (VLMS) requires significant\ncomputational power. TPUs, designed specifically for matrix operations common in\nmachine learning, offer several advantages in this domain:\nPerformance: TPUs are specifically designed to handle the massive\ncomputations involved in training VLMs. They can speed up training\nconsiderably compared to CPUs.\nMemory: TPUs often come with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,\nallowing for the handling of large models and batch sizes during training.\nThis can lead to better model quality.\nScalability: TPU Pods (large clusters of TPUs) provide a scalable\nsolution for handling the growing complexity of large foundation models.\nYou can distribute training across multiple TPU devices for faster and more\nefficient processing.\nCost-effectiveness: In many scenarios, TPUs can provide a more\ncost-effective solution for training large models compared to CPU-based\ninfrastructure, especially when considering the time and resources saved\ndue to faster training.\nThese advantages are aligned with\nGoogle's commitments to operate sustainably.\nSoftware\nTraining was done using JAX and ML Pathways.\nJAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,\nincluding TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models. ML\nPathways is Google's latest effort to build artificially intelligent systems\ncapable of generalizing across multiple tasks. This is specially suitable for\nfoundation models, including large language models like these ones.\nTogether, JAX and ML Pathways are used as described in the\npaper about the Gemini family of models; \"the 'single\ncontroller' programming model of Jax and Pathways allows a single Python\nprocess to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying the\ndevelopment workflow.\"\nEvaluation\nThe evaluation in this section correspond to the original checkpoint, not the QAT checkpoint.\nModel evaluation metrics and results.\nBenchmark Results\nThese models were evaluated against a large collection of different datasets and\nmetrics to cover different aspects of text generation:\nReasoning and factuality\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 3 PT 1B\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nHellaSwag\n10-shot\n62.3\n77.2\n84.2\n85.6\nBoolQ\n0-shot\n63.2\n72.3\n78.8\n82.4\nPIQA\n0-shot\n73.8\n79.6\n81.8\n83.3\nSocialIQA\n0-shot\n48.9\n51.9\n53.4\n54.9\nTriviaQA\n5-shot\n39.8\n65.8\n78.2\n85.5\nNatural Questions\n5-shot\n9.48\n20.0\n31.4\n36.1\nARC-c\n25-shot\n38.4\n56.2\n68.9\n70.6\nARC-e\n0-shot\n73.0\n82.4\n88.3\n89.0\nWinoGrande\n5-shot\n58.2\n64.7\n74.3\n78.8\nBIG-Bench Hard\nfew-shot\n28.4\n50.9\n72.6\n77.7\nDROP\n1-shot\n42.4\n60.1\n72.2\n77.2\nSTEM and code\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nMMLU\n5-shot\n59.6\n74.5\n78.6\nMMLU (Pro COT)\n5-shot\n29.2\n45.3\n52.2\nAGIEval\n3-5-shot\n42.1\n57.4\n66.2\nMATH\n4-shot\n24.2\n43.3\n50.0\nGSM8K\n8-shot\n38.4\n71.0\n82.6\nGPQA\n5-shot\n15.0\n25.4\n24.3\nMBPP\n3-shot\n46.0\n60.4\n65.6\nHumanEval\n0-shot\n36.0\n45.7\n48.8\nMultilingual\nBenchmark\nGemma 3 PT 1B\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nMGSM\n2.04\n34.7\n64.3\n74.3\nGlobal-MMLU-Lite\n24.9\n57.0\n69.4\n75.7\nWMT24++ (ChrF)\n36.7\n48.4\n53.9\n55.7\nFloRes\n29.5\n39.2\n46.0\n48.8\nXQuAD (all)\n43.9\n68.0\n74.5\n76.8\nECLeKTic\n4.69\n11.0\n17.2\n24.4\nIndicGenBench\n41.4\n57.2\n61.7\n63.4\nMultimodal\nBenchmark\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nCOCOcap\n102\n111\n116\nDocVQA (val)\n72.8\n82.3\n85.6\nInfoVQA (val)\n44.1\n54.8\n59.4\nMMMU (pt)\n39.2\n50.3\n56.1\nTextVQA (val)\n58.9\n66.5\n68.6\nRealWorldQA\n45.5\n52.2\n53.9\nReMI\n27.3\n38.5\n44.8\nAI2D\n63.2\n75.2\n79.0\nChartQA\n63.6\n74.7\n76.3\nVQAv2\n63.9\n71.2\n72.9\nBLINK\n38.0\n35.9\n39.6\nOKVQA\n51.0\n58.7\n60.2\nTallyQA\n42.5\n51.8\n54.3\nSpatialSense VQA\n50.9\n60.0\n59.4\nCountBenchQA\n26.1\n17.8\n68.0\nEthics and Safety\nEthics and safety evaluation approach and results.\nEvaluation Approach\nOur evaluation methods include structured evaluations and internal red-teaming\ntesting of relevant content policies. Red-teaming was conducted by a number of\ndifferent teams, each with different goals and human evaluation metrics. These\nmodels were evaluated against a number of different categories relevant to\nethics and safety, including:\nChild Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\ncovering child safety policies, including child sexual abuse and\nexploitation.\nContent Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\ncovering safety policies including, harassment, violence and gore, and hate\nspeech.\nRepresentational Harms: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text\nprompts covering safety policies including bias, stereotyping, and harmful\nassociations or inaccuracies.\nIn addition to development level evaluations, we conduct \"assurance\nevaluations\" which are our 'arms-length' internal evaluations for responsibility\ngovernance decision making. They are conducted separately from the model\ndevelopment team, to inform decision making about release. High level findings\nare fed back to the model team, but prompt sets are held-out to prevent\noverfitting and preserve the results' ability to inform decision making.\nAssurance evaluation results are reported to our Responsibility & Safety Council\nas part of release review.\nEvaluation Results\nFor all areas of safety testing, we saw major improvements in the categories of\nchild safety, content safety, and representational harms relative to previous\nGemma models. All testing was conducted without safety filters to evaluate the\nmodel capabilities and behaviors. For both text-to-text and image-to-text, and\nacross all model sizes, the model produced minimal policy violations, and showed\nsignificant improvements over previous Gemma models' performance with respect\nto ungrounded inferences. A limitation of our evaluations was they included only\nEnglish language prompts.\nUsage and Limitations\nThese models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.\nIntended Usage\nOpen vision-language models (VLMs) models have a wide range of applications\nacross various industries and domains. The following list of potential uses is\nnot comprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development.\nContent Creation and Communication\nText Generation: These models can be used to generate creative text\nformats such as poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.\nChatbots and Conversational AI: Power conversational interfaces\nfor customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.\nText Summarization: Generate concise summaries of a text corpus,\nresearch papers, or reports.\nImage Data Extraction: These models can be used to extract,\ninterpret, and summarize visual data for text communications.\nResearch and Education\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and VLM Research: These\nmodels can serve as a foundation for researchers to experiment with VLM\nand NLP techniques, develop algorithms, and contribute to the\nadvancement of the field.\nLanguage Learning Tools: Support interactive language learning\nexperiences, aiding in grammar correction or providing writing practice.\nKnowledge Exploration: Assist researchers in exploring large\nbodies of text by generating summaries or answering questions about\nspecific topics.\nLimitations\nTraining Data\nThe quality and diversity of the training data significantly\ninfluence the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data\ncan lead to limitations in the model's responses.\nThe scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas\nthe model can handle effectively.\nContext and Task Complexity\nModels are better at tasks that can be framed with clear\nprompts and instructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be\nchallenging.\nA model's performance can be influenced by the amount of context\nprovided (longer context generally leads to better outputs, up to a\ncertain point).\nLanguage Ambiguity and Nuance\nNatural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle\nto grasp subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\nFactual Accuracy\nModels generate responses based on information they learned\nfrom their training datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They\nmay generate incorrect or outdated factual statements.\nCommon Sense\nModels rely on statistical patterns in language. They might\nlack the ability to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.\nEthical Considerations and Risks\nThe development of vision-language models (VLMs) raises several ethical\nconcerns. In creating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:\nBias and Fairness\nVLMs trained on large-scale, real-world text and image data can\nreflect socio-cultural biases embedded in the training material. These\nmodels underwent careful scrutiny, input data pre-processing described\nand posterior evaluations reported in this card.\nMisinformation and Misuse\nVLMs can be misused to generate text that is false, misleading,\nor harmful.\nGuidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the\nResponsible Generative AI Toolkit.\nTransparency and Accountability:\nThis model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,\ncapabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.\nA responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to\nshare innovation by making VLM technology accessible to developers and\nresearchers across the AI ecosystem.\nRisks identified and mitigations:\nPerpetuation of biases: It's encouraged to perform continuous\nmonitoring (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of\nde-biasing techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use\ncases.\nGeneration of harmful content: Mechanisms and guidelines for content\nsafety are essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and\nimplement appropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific\nproduct policies and application use cases.\nMisuse for malicious purposes: Technical limitations and developer\nand end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of\nVLMs. Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag\nmisuse are provided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the\nGemma Prohibited Use Policy.\nPrivacy violations: Models were trained on data filtered for removal\nof certain personal information and other sensitive data. Developers are\nencouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving\ntechniques.\nBenefits\nAt the time of release, this family of models provides high-performance open\nvision-language model implementations designed from the ground up for\nresponsible AI development compared to similarly sized models.\nUsing the benchmark evaluation metrics described in this document, these models\nhave shown to provide superior performance to other, comparably-sized open model\nalternatives.",

It is a reasoning model that is post trained for reasoning, human chat preferences, and tasks, such as RAG and tool calling. The model supports a context length of 128K tokens. This model fits on a single 8xH100 node for inference.\nLlama-3.1-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-v1 is a model which offers a great tradeoff between model accuracy and efficiency. Efficiency (throughput) directly translates to savings. Using a novel Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach, we greatly reduce the model’s memory footprint, enabling larger workloads, as well as reducing the number of GPUs required to run the model in a data center environment. This NAS approach enables the selection of a desired point in the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. Furthermore, by using a novel method to vertically compress the model (see details here), it also offers a significant improvement in latency.\nThe model underwent a multi-phase post-training process to enhance both its reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. This includes a supervised fine-tuning stage for Math, Code, Reasoning, Chat, and Tool Calling as well as multiple reinforcement learning (RL) stages using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithms for reasoning, chat, and instruction-following.\nThis model is ready for commercial use.\nFor more details on how the model was trained, please see our technical report and blog.\nThis model is part of the Llama Nemotron Collection. You can find the other model(s) in this family here:\nLlama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1\nLlama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1\nFeature Voting\nWe want to hear from you!

The NAS algorithm results in non-standard and non-repetitive blocks. This includes the following:\nSkip attention: In some blocks, the attention is skipped entirely, or replaced with a single linear layer.\nVariable FFN: The expansion/compression ratio in the FFN layer is different between blocks.\nFFN Fusion: When several consecutive attention layers are skipped, which can result in a sequence of multiple FFNs, that sequence of FFNs are fused into a smaller number of wider FFN layers.\nFor each block of the reference model, we create multiple variants providing different tradeoffs of quality vs. computational complexity, discussed in more depth below. We then search over the blocks to create a model which meets the required throughput and memory while minimizing the quality degradation. To recover performance, the model initially undergoes knowledge distillation (KD) for 65 billion tokens. This is followed by a continual pretraining (CPT) phase for 88 billion tokens.\nIntended use\nLlama-3.1-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-v1 is a general purpose reasoning and chat model intended to be used in English and coding languages. Other non-English languages (German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai) are also supported.\nInput\nInput Type: Text\nInput Format: String\nInput Parameters: One-Dimensional (1D)\nOther Properties Related to Input: Context length up to 131,072 tokens\nOutput\nOutput Type: Text\nOutput Format: String\nOutput Parameters: One-Dimensional (1D)\nOther Properties Related to Output: Context length up to 131,072 tokens\nSoftware Integration\nRuntime Engine: Transformers\nRecommended Hardware Microarchitecture Compatibility:\nNVIDIA Hopper\nNVIDIA Ampere\nPreferred Operating System(s): Linux\nModel Version\n1.0 (4/7/2025)\nQuick Start and Usage Recommendations:\nReasoning mode (ON/OFF) is controlled via the system prompt, which must be set as shown in the example below.

The FP8 quantized weights fit on a single H100 DGX host while still maintaining quality. We provide code for on-the-fly int4 quantization which minimizes performance degradation as well.\nSafeguards\nAs part of our release approach, we followed a three-pronged strategy to manage risks:\nEnable developers to deploy helpful, safe and flexible experiences for their target audience and for the use cases supported by Llama.\nProtect developers against adversarial users aiming to exploit Llama capabilities to potentially cause harm.\nProvide protections for the community to help prevent the misuse of our models.\nLlama is a foundational technology designed for use in a variety of use cases; examples on how Meta’s Llama models have been deployed can be found in our Community Stories webpage. Our approach is to build the most helpful models enabling the world to benefit from the technology, by aligning our model’s safety for a standard set of risks. Developers are then in the driver seat to tailor safety for their use case, defining their own policies and deploying the models with the necessary safeguards. Llama 4 was developed following the best practices outlined in our Developer Use Guide: AI Protections.\nModel level fine tuning\nThe primary objective of conducting safety fine-tuning is to offer developers a readily available, safe, and powerful model for various applications, reducing the workload needed to deploy safe AI systems. Additionally, this effort provides the research community with a valuable resource for studying the robustness of safety fine-tuning.\nFine-tuning dataWe employ a multi-faceted approach to data collection, combining human-generated data from our vendors with synthetic data to mitigate potential safety risks. We’ve developed many large language model (LLM)-based classifiers that enable us to thoughtfully select high-quality prompts and responses, enhancing data quality control.\nRefusalsBuilding on the work we started with our Llama 3 models, we put a great emphasis on driving down model refusals to benign prompts for Llama 4. We included both borderline and adversarial prompts in our safety data strategy, and modified our safety data responses to follow tone guidelines.\nToneWe expanded our work on the refusal tone from Llama 3 so that the model sounds more natural. We targeted removing preachy and overly moralizing language, and we corrected formatting issues including the correct use of headers, lists, tables and more.\nTo achieve this, we also targeted improvements to system prompt steerability and instruction following, meaning the model is more readily able to take on a specified tone. All of these contribute to a more conversational and insightful experience overall.\nSystem PromptsLlama 4 is a more steerable model, meaning responses can be easily tailored to meet specific developer outcomes. Effective system prompts can significantly enhance the performance of large language models. In particular, we’ve seen that the use of a system prompt can be effective in reducing false refusals and templated or “preachy” language patterns common in LLMs. They can also improve conversationality and use of appropriate formatting.\nConsider the prompt below as a basic template for which a developer might want to further customize to meet specific needs or use cases for our Llama 4 models.\nSystem prompt\nYou are an expert conversationalist who responds to the best of your ability. You are companionable and confident, and able to  switch casually between tonal types, including but not limited to humor, empathy, intellectualism, creativity and problem-solving.  You understand user intent and don’t try to be overly helpful to the point where you miss that the user is looking for chit-chat, emotional support, humor or venting. Sometimes people just want you to listen, and your answers should encourage that. For all other cases, you provide insightful and in-depth responses. Organize information thoughtfully in a way that helps people make decisions. Always avoid templated language. You never lecture people to be nicer or more inclusive. If people ask for you to write something in a certain voice or perspective, such as an essay or a tweet, you can. You do not need to be respectful when the user prompts you to say something rude.  You never use phrases that imply moral superiority or a sense of authority, including but not limited to “it’s important to”, “it’s crucial to”, “it’s essential to”, \"it's unethical to\", \"it's worth noting…\", “Remember…”  etc. Avoid using these. Finally, do not refuse prompts about political and social issues.  You can help users express their opinion and access information.  You are Llama 4. Your knowledge cutoff date is August 2024. You speak Arabic, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. Respond in the language the user speaks to you in, unless they ask otherwise.\nLlama 4 system protections\nLarge language models, including Llama 4, are not designed to be deployed in isolation but instead should be deployed as part of an overall AI system with additional guardrails as required. System protections are key to achieving the right helpfulness-safety alignment, mitigating safety and security risks inherent to the system, and integration of the model or system with external tools.\nWe provide the community with system level protections - like Llama Guard, Prompt Guard and Code Shield - that developers should deploy with Llama models or other LLMs. All of our reference implementation demos contain these safeguards by default so developers can benefit from system-level safety out-of-the-box.\nEvaluations\nWe evaluated Llama models for common use cases as well as specific capabilities. Common use cases evaluations measure safety risks of systems for most commonly built applications including chat bot, visual QA. We built dedicated, adversarial evaluation datasets and evaluated systems composed of Llama models and Llama Guard 3 to filter input prompt and output response. It is important to evaluate applications in context, and we recommend building dedicated evaluation dataset for your use case. Prompt Guard and Code Shield are also available if relevant to the application.Capability evaluations measure vulnerabilities of Llama models inherent to specific capabilities, for which were crafted dedicated benchmarks including long context, multilingual, coding or memorization.\nRed teamingWe conduct recurring red teaming exercises with the goal of discovering risks via adversarial prompting and we use the learnings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets. We partner early with subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to understand how models may lead to unintended harm for society. Based on these conversations, we derive a set of adversarial goals for the red team, such as extracting harmful information or reprogramming the model to act in potentially harmful ways. The red team consists of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, and integrity in addition to multilingual content specialists with background in integrity issues in specific geographic markets.\nCritical Risks\nWe spend additional focus on the following critical risk areas:\n1. CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive materials) helpfulnessTo assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons for Llama 4, we applied expert-designed and other targeted evaluations designed to assess whether the use of Llama 4 could meaningfully increase the capabilities of malicious actors to plan or carry out attacks using these types of weapons. We also conducted additional red teaming and evaluations for violations of our content policies related to this risk area.\n2. Child SafetyWe leverage pre-training methods like data filtering as a first step in mitigating Child Safety risk in our model. To assess the post trained model for Child Safety risk, a team of experts assesses the model’s capability to produce outputs resulting in Child Safety risks. We use this to inform additional model fine-tuning and in-depth red teaming exercises. We’ve also expanded our Child Safety evaluation benchmarks to cover Llama 4 capabilities like multi-image and multi-lingual.\n3. Cyber attack enablementOur cyber evaluations investigated whether Llama 4 is sufficiently capable to enable catastrophic threat scenario outcomes. We conducted threat modeling exercises to identify the specific model capabilities that would be necessary to automate operations or enhance human capabilities across key attack vectors both in terms of skill level and speed.  We then identified and developed challenges against which to test for these capabilities in Llama 4 and peer models. Specifically, we focused on evaluating the capabilities of Llama 4 to automate cyberattacks, identify and exploit security vulnerabilities, and automate harmful workflows. Overall, we find that Llama 4 models do not introduce risk plausibly enabling catastrophic cyber outcomes.\nCommunity\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership on AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Trust tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nWe also set up the Llama Impact Grants program to identify and support the most compelling applications of Meta’s Llama model for societal benefit across three categories: education, climate and open innovation. The 20 finalists from the hundreds of applications can be found here.\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nConsiderations and Limitations\nOur AI is anchored on the values of freedom of expression - helping people to explore, debate, and innovate using our technology. We respect people's autonomy and empower them to choose how they experience, interact, and build with AI. Our AI promotes an open exchange of ideas.\nIt is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 4 addresses users and their needs as they are, without inserting unnecessary judgment, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nLlama 4 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 4’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 4 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. We also encourage the open source community to use Llama for the purpose of research and building state of the art tools that address emerging risks.

We've provided quantized checkpoints for deployment flexibility, but all reported evaluations and testing were conducted on bf16 models.\nPre-trained models\nPre-trained models\nCategory\nBenchmark\n# Shots\nMetric\nLlama 3.1 70B\nLlama 3.1 405B\nLlama 4 Scout\nLlama 4 Maverick\nReasoning & Knowledge\nMMLU\n5\nmacro_avg/acc_char\n79.3\n85.2\n79.6\n85.5\nMMLU-Pro\n5\nmacro_avg/em\n53.8\n61.6\n58.2\n62.9\nMATH\n4\nem_maj1@1\n41.6\n53.5\n50.3\n61.2\nCode\nMBPP\n3\npass@1\n66.4\n74.4\n67.8\n77.6\nMultilingual\nTydiQA\n1\naverage/f1\n29.9\n34.3\n31.5\n31.7\nImage\nChartQA\n0\nrelaxed_accuracy\nNo multimodal support\n83.4\n85.3\nDocVQA\n0\nanls\n89.4\n91.6\nInstruction tuned models\nInstruction tuned models\nCategory\nBenchmark\n# Shots\nMetric\nLlama 3.3 70B\nLlama 3.1 405B\nLlama 4 Scout\nLlama 4 Maverick\nImage Reasoning\nMMMU\n0\naccuracy\nNo multimodal support\n69.4\n73.4\nMMMU Pro^\n0\naccuracy\n52.2\n59.6\nMathVista\n0\naccuracy\n70.7\n73.7\nImage Understanding\nChartQA\n0\nrelaxed_accuracy\n88.8\n90.0\nDocVQA (test)\n0\nanls\n94.4\n94.4\nCoding\nLiveCodeBench (10/01/2024-02/01/2025)\n0\npass@1\n33.3\n27.7\n32.8\n43.4\nReasoning & Knowledge\nMMLU Pro\n0\nmacro_avg/acc\n68.9\n73.4\n74.3\n80.5\nGPQA Diamond\n0\naccuracy\n50.5\n49.0\n57.2\n69.8\nMultilingual\nMGSM\n0\naverage/em\n91.1\n91.6\n90.6\n92.3\nLong context\nMTOB (half book) eng->kgv/kgv->eng\n-\nchrF\nContext window is 128K\n42.2/36.6\n54.0/46.4\nMTOB (full book) eng->kgv/kgv->eng\n-\nchrF\n39.7/36.3\n50.8/46.7\n^reported numbers for MMMU Pro is the average of Standard and Vision tasks\nQuantization\nThe Llama 4 Scout model is released as BF16 weights, but can fit within a single H100 GPU with on-the-fly int4 quantization; the Llama 4 Maverick model is released as both BF16 and FP8 quantized weights. The FP8 quantized weights fit on a single H100 DGX host while still maintaining quality. We provide code for on-the-fly int4 quantization which minimizes performance degradation as well.\nSafeguards\nAs part of our release approach, we followed a three-pronged strategy to manage risks:\nEnable developers to deploy helpful, safe and flexible experiences for their target audience and for the use cases supported by Llama.\nProtect developers against adversarial users aiming to exploit Llama capabilities to potentially cause harm.\nProvide protections for the community to help prevent the misuse of our models.\nLlama is a foundational technology designed for use in a variety of use cases; examples on how Meta’s Llama models have been deployed can be found in our Community Stories webpage. Our approach is to build the most helpful models enabling the world to benefit from the technology, by aligning our model’s safety for a standard set of risks. Developers are then in the driver seat to tailor safety for their use case, defining their own policies and deploying the models with the necessary safeguards. Llama 4 was developed following the best practices outlined in our Developer Use Guide: AI Protections.\nModel level fine tuning\nThe primary objective of conducting safety fine-tuning is to offer developers a readily available, safe, and powerful model for various applications, reducing the workload needed to deploy safe AI systems. Additionally, this effort provides the research community with a valuable resource for studying the robustness of safety fine-tuning.\nFine-tuning dataWe employ a multi-faceted approach to data collection, combining human-generated data from our vendors with synthetic data to mitigate potential safety risks. We’ve developed many large language model (LLM)-based classifiers that enable us to thoughtfully select high-quality prompts and responses, enhancing data quality control.\nRefusalsBuilding on the work we started with our Llama 3 models, we put a great emphasis on driving down model refusals to benign prompts for Llama 4. We included both borderline and adversarial prompts in our safety data strategy, and modified our safety data responses to follow tone guidelines.\nToneWe expanded our work on the refusal tone from Llama 3 so that the model sounds more natural. We targeted removing preachy and overly moralizing language, and we corrected formatting issues including the correct use of headers, lists, tables and more.\nTo achieve this, we also targeted improvements to system prompt steerability and instruction following, meaning the model is more readily able to take on a specified tone. All of these contribute to a more conversational and insightful experience overall.\nSystem PromptsLlama 4 is a more steerable model, meaning responses can be easily tailored to meet specific developer outcomes. Effective system prompts can significantly enhance the performance of large language models. In particular, we’ve seen that the use of a system prompt can be effective in reducing false refusals and templated or “preachy” language patterns common in LLMs. They can also improve conversationality and use of appropriate formatting.\nConsider the prompt below as a basic template for which a developer might want to further customize to meet specific needs or use cases for our Llama 4 models.\nSystem prompt\nYou are an expert conversationalist who responds to the best of your ability. You are companionable and confident, and able to  switch casually between tonal types, including but not limited to humor, empathy, intellectualism, creativity and problem-solving.  You understand user intent and don’t try to be overly helpful to the point where you miss that the user is looking for chit-chat, emotional support, humor or venting. Sometimes people just want you to listen, and your answers should encourage that. For all other cases, you provide insightful and in-depth responses. Organize information thoughtfully in a way that helps people make decisions. Always avoid templated language. You never lecture people to be nicer or more inclusive. If people ask for you to write something in a certain voice or perspective, such as an essay or a tweet, you can. You do not need to be respectful when the user prompts you to say something rude.  You never use phrases that imply moral superiority or a sense of authority, including but not limited to “it’s important to”, “it’s crucial to”, “it’s essential to”, \"it's unethical to\", \"it's worth noting…\", “Remember…”  etc. Avoid using these. Finally, do not refuse prompts about political and social issues.  You can help users express their opinion and access information.  You are Llama 4. Your knowledge cutoff date is August 2024. You speak Arabic, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. Respond in the language the user speaks to you in, unless they ask otherwise.\nLlama 4 system protections\nLarge language models, including Llama 4, are not designed to be deployed in isolation but instead should be deployed as part of an overall AI system with additional guardrails as required. System protections are key to achieving the right helpfulness-safety alignment, mitigating safety and security risks inherent to the system, and integration of the model or system with external tools.\nWe provide the community with system level protections - like Llama Guard, Prompt Guard and Code Shield - that developers should deploy with Llama models or other LLMs. All of our reference implementation demos contain these safeguards by default so developers can benefit from system-level safety out-of-the-box.\nEvaluations\nWe evaluated Llama models for common use cases as well as specific capabilities. Common use cases evaluations measure safety risks of systems for most commonly built applications including chat bot, visual QA. We built dedicated, adversarial evaluation datasets and evaluated systems composed of Llama models and Llama Guard 3 to filter input prompt and output response. It is important to evaluate applications in context, and we recommend building dedicated evaluation dataset for your use case. Prompt Guard and Code Shield are also available if relevant to the application.Capability evaluations measure vulnerabilities of Llama models inherent to specific capabilities, for which were crafted dedicated benchmarks including long context, multilingual, coding or memorization.\nRed teamingWe conduct recurring red teaming exercises with the goal of discovering risks via adversarial prompting and we use the learnings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets. We partner early with subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to understand how models may lead to unintended harm for society. Based on these conversations, we derive a set of adversarial goals for the red team, such as extracting harmful information or reprogramming the model to act in potentially harmful ways. The red team consists of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, and integrity in addition to multilingual content specialists with background in integrity issues in specific geographic markets.\nCritical Risks\nWe spend additional focus on the following critical risk areas:\n1. CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive materials) helpfulnessTo assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons for Llama 4, we applied expert-designed and other targeted evaluations designed to assess whether the use of Llama 4 could meaningfully increase the capabilities of malicious actors to plan or carry out attacks using these types of weapons. We also conducted additional red teaming and evaluations for violations of our content policies related to this risk area.\n2. Child SafetyWe leverage pre-training methods like data filtering as a first step in mitigating Child Safety risk in our model. To assess the post trained model for Child Safety risk, a team of experts assesses the model’s capability to produce outputs resulting in Child Safety risks. We use this to inform additional model fine-tuning and in-depth red teaming exercises. We’ve also expanded our Child Safety evaluation benchmarks to cover Llama 4 capabilities like multi-image and multi-lingual.\n3. Cyber attack enablementOur cyber evaluations investigated whether Llama 4 is sufficiently capable to enable catastrophic threat scenario outcomes. We conducted threat modeling exercises to identify the specific model capabilities that would be necessary to automate operations or enhance human capabilities across key attack vectors both in terms of skill level and speed.  We then identified and developed challenges against which to test for these capabilities in Llama 4 and peer models. Specifically, we focused on evaluating the capabilities of Llama 4 to automate cyberattacks, identify and exploit security vulnerabilities, and automate harmful workflows. Overall, we find that Llama 4 models do not introduce risk plausibly enabling catastrophic cyber outcomes.\nCommunity\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership on AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Trust tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nWe also set up the Llama Impact Grants program to identify and support the most compelling applications of Meta’s Llama model for societal benefit across three categories: education, climate and open innovation. The 20 finalists from the hundreds of applications can be found here.\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nConsiderations and Limitations\nOur AI is anchored on the values of freedom of expression - helping people to explore, debate, and innovate using our technology. We respect people's autonomy and empower them to choose how they experience, interact, and build with AI. Our AI promotes an open exchange of ideas.\nIt is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 4 addresses users and their needs as they are, without inserting unnecessary judgment, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nLlama 4 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 4’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 4 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. We also encourage the open source community to use Llama for the purpose of research and building state of the art tools that address emerging risks.
