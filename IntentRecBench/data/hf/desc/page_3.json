    "ai-forever/FRIDA": "Model Card for FRIDA\nUsage\nTransformers\nSentenceTransformers\nAuthors\nCitation\nLimitations\nModel Card for FRIDA\nFRIDA is a full-scale finetuned general text embedding model inspired by denoising architecture based on T5. The model is based on the encoder part of FRED-T5 model and continues research of text embedding models (ruMTEB, ru-en-RoSBERTa). It has been pre-trained on a Russian-English dataset and fine-tuned for improved performance on the target task.\nFor more model details please refer to our article (RU).\nUsage\nThe model can be used as is with prefixes. It is recommended to use CLS pooling. The choice of prefix and pooling depends on the task.\nWe use the following basic rules to choose a prefix:\n\"search_query: \" and \"search_document: \" prefixes are for answer or relevant paragraph retrieval\n\"paraphrase: \" prefix is for symmetric paraphrasing related tasks (STS, paraphrase mining, deduplication)\n\"categorize: \" prefix is for asymmetric matching of document title and body (e.g. news, scientific papers, social posts)\n\"categorize_sentiment: \" prefix is for any tasks that rely on sentiment features (e.g. hate, toxic, emotion)\n\"categorize_topic: \" prefix is intended for tasks where you need to group texts by topic\n\"categorize_entailment: \" prefix is for textual entailment task (NLI)\nTo better tailor the model to your needs, you can fine-tune it with relevant high-quality Russian and English datasets.\nBelow are examples of texts encoding using the Transformers and SentenceTransformers libraries.\nTransformers\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, T5EncoderModel\ndef pool(hidden_state, mask, pooling_method=\"cls\"):\nif pooling_method == \"mean\":\ns = torch.sum(hidden_state * mask.unsqueeze(-1).float(), dim=1)\nd = mask.sum(axis=1, keepdim=True).float()\nreturn s / d\nelif pooling_method == \"cls\":\nreturn hidden_state[:, 0]\ninputs = [\n#\n\"paraphrase: В Ярославской области разрешили работу бань, но без посетителей\",\n\"categorize_entailment: Женщину доставили в больницу, за ее жизнь сейчас борются врачи.\",\n\"search_query: Сколько программистов нужно, чтобы вкрутить лампочку?\",\n#\n\"paraphrase: Ярославским баням разрешили работать без посетителей\",\n\"categorize_entailment: Женщину спасают врачи.\",\n\"search_document: Чтобы вкрутить лампочку, требуется три программиста: один напишет программу извлечения лампочки, другой — вкручивания лампочки, а третий проведет тестирование.\"\n]\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"ai-forever/FRIDA\")\nmodel = T5EncoderModel.from_pretrained(\"ai-forever/FRIDA\")\ntokenized_inputs = tokenizer(inputs, max_length=512, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nwith torch.no_grad():\noutputs = model(**tokenized_inputs)\nembeddings = pool(\noutputs.last_hidden_state,\ntokenized_inputs[\"attention_mask\"],\npooling_method=\"cls\" # or try \"mean\"\n)\nembeddings = F.normalize(embeddings, p=2, dim=1)\nsim_scores = embeddings[:3] @ embeddings[3:].T\nprint(sim_scores.diag().tolist())\n# [0.9360030293464661, 0.8591322302818298, 0.728583037853241]\nSentenceTransformers\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\ninputs = [\n#\n\"paraphrase: В Ярославской области разрешили работу бань, но без посетителей\",\n\"categorize_entailment: Женщину доставили в больницу, за ее жизнь сейчас борются врачи.\",\n\"search_query: Сколько программистов нужно, чтобы вкрутить лампочку?\",\n#\n\"paraphrase: Ярославским баням разрешили работать без посетителей\",\n\"categorize_entailment: Женщину спасают врачи.\",\n\"search_document: Чтобы вкрутить лампочку, требуется три программиста: один напишет программу извлечения лампочки, другой — вкручивания лампочки, а третий проведет тестирование.\"\n]\n# loads model with CLS pooling\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\"ai-forever/FRIDA\")\n# embeddings are normalized by default\nembeddings = model.encode(inputs, convert_to_tensor=True)\nsim_scores = embeddings[:3] @ embeddings[3:].T\nprint(sim_scores.diag().tolist())\n# [0.9360026717185974, 0.8591331243515015, 0.7285830974578857]\nor using prompts (sentence-transformers>=2.4.0):\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n# loads model with CLS pooling\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\"ai-forever/FRIDA\")\nparaphrase = model.encode([\"В Ярославской области разрешили работу бань, но без посетителей\", \"Ярославским баням разрешили работать без посетителей\"], prompt_name=\"paraphrase\")\nprint(paraphrase[0] @ paraphrase[1].T) # 0.9360032\ncategorize_entailment = model.encode([\"Женщину доставили в больницу, за ее жизнь сейчас борются врачи.\", \"Женщину спасают врачи.\"], prompt_name=\"categorize_entailment\")\nprint(categorize_entailment[0] @ categorize_entailment[1].T) # 0.8591322\nquery_embedding = model.encode(\"Сколько программистов нужно, чтобы вкрутить лампочку?\", prompt_name=\"search_query\")\ndocument_embedding = model.encode(\"Чтобы вкрутить лампочку, требуется три программиста: один напишет программу извлечения лампочки, другой — вкручивания лампочки, а третий проведет тестирование.\", prompt_name=\"search_document\")\nprint(query_embedding @ document_embedding.T) # 0.7285831\nAuthors\nSaluteDevices AI for B2C RnD Team.\nArtem Snegirev: HF profile, Github;\nAnna Maksimova HF profile;\nAleksandr Abramov: HF profile, Github, Kaggle Competitions Master\nCitation\n@misc{TODO\n}\nLimitations\nThe model is designed to process texts in Russian, the quality in English is unknown.

For more technical information about generation parameters and recipes for how to use Llama 3.2 in applications, please go here.\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases: Llama 3.2 is intended for commercial and research use in multiple languages. Instruction tuned text only models are intended for assistant-like chat and agentic applications like knowledge retrieval and summarization, mobile AI powered writing assistants and query and prompt rewriting. Pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of additional natural language generation tasks. Similarly, quantized models can be adapted for a variety of on-device use-cases with limited compute resources.\nOut of Scope: Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3.2 Community License. Use in languages beyond those explicitly referenced as supported in this model card.\nHow to use\nThis repository contains two versions of Llama-3.2-1B, for use with transformers and with the original llama codebase.\nUse with transformers\nStarting with transformers >= 4.43.0 onward, you can run conversational inference using the Transformers pipeline abstraction or by leveraging the Auto classes with the generate() function.\nMake sure to update your transformers installation via pip install --upgrade transformers.\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B\"\npipe = pipeline(\n\"text-generation\",\nmodel=model_id,\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\npipe(\"The key to life is\")\nUse with llama\nPlease, follow the instructions in the repository.\nTo download Original checkpoints, see the example command below leveraging huggingface-cli:\nhuggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B --include \"original/*\" --local-dir Llama-3.2-1B\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors: We used custom training libraries, Meta's custom built GPU cluster, and production infrastructure for pretraining. Fine-tuning, quantization, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on production infrastructure.\nTraining Energy Use: Training utilized a cumulative of 916k GPU hours of computation on H100-80GB (TDP of 700W) type hardware, per the table below. Training time is the total GPU time required for training each model and power consumption is the peak power capacity per GPU device used, adjusted for power usage efficiency.\nTraining Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Estimated total location-based greenhouse gas emissions were 240 tons CO2eq for training. Since 2020, Meta has maintained net zero greenhouse gas emissions in its global operations and matched 100% of its electricity use with renewable energy; therefore, the total market-based greenhouse gas emissions for training were 0 tons CO2eq.\nTraining Time (GPU hours)\nLogit Generation Time (GPU Hours)\nTraining Power Consumption (W)\nTraining Location-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tons CO2eq)\nTraining Market-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tons CO2eq)\nLlama 3.2 1B\n370k\n-\n700\n107\n0\nLlama 3.2 3B\n460k\n-\n700\n133\n0\nLlama 3.2 1B SpinQuant\n1.7\n0\n700\nNegligible**\n0\nLlama 3.2 3B SpinQuant\n2.4\n0\n700\nNegligible**\n0\nLlama 3.2 1B QLora\n1.3k\n0\n700\n0.381\n0\nLlama 3.2 3B QLora\n1.6k\n0\n700\n0.461\n0\nTotal\n833k\n86k\n240\n0\n** The location-based CO2e emissions of Llama 3.2 1B SpinQuant and Llama 3.2 3B SpinQuant are less than 0.001 metric tonnes each. This is due to the minimal training GPU hours that are required.\nThe methodology used to determine training energy use and greenhouse gas emissions can be found here. Since Meta is openly releasing these models, the training energy use and greenhouse gas emissions will not be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview: Llama 3.2 was pretrained on up to 9 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. For the 1B and 3B Llama 3.2 models, we incorporated logits from the Llama 3.1 8B and 70B models into the pretraining stage of the model development, where outputs (logits) from these larger models were used as token-level targets. Knowledge distillation was used after pruning to recover performance. In post-training we used a similar recipe as Llama 3.1 and produced final chat models by doing several rounds of alignment on top of the pre-trained model. Each round involved Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Rejection Sampling (RS), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\nData Freshness: The pretraining data has a cutoff of December 2023.\nQuantization\nQuantization Scheme\nWe designed the current quantization scheme with the PyTorch’s ExecuTorch inference framework and Arm CPU backend in mind, taking into account metrics including model quality, prefill/decoding speed, and memory footprint. Our quantization scheme involves three parts:\nAll linear layers in all transformer blocks are quantized to a 4-bit groupwise scheme (with a group size of 32) for weights and 8-bit per-token dynamic quantization for activations.\nThe classification layer is quantized to 8-bit per-channel for weight and 8-bit per token dynamic quantization for activation.\nSimilar to classification layer, an 8-bit per channel quantization is used for embedding layer.\nQuantization-Aware Training and LoRA\nThe quantization-aware training (QAT) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) models went through only post-training stages, using the same data as the full precision models. To initialize QAT, we utilize BF16 Llama 3.2 model checkpoints obtained after supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and perform an additional full round of SFT training with QAT. We then freeze the backbone of the QAT model and perform another round of SFT with LoRA adaptors applied to all layers within the transformer block. Meanwhile, the LoRA adaptors' weights and activations are maintained in BF16. Because our approach is similar to QLoRA of Dettmers et al., (2023) (i.e., quantization followed by LoRA adapters), we refer this method as QLoRA. Finally, we fine-tune the resulting model (both backbone and LoRA adaptors) using direct preference optimization (DPO).\nSpinQuant\nSpinQuant was applied, together with generative post-training quantization (GPTQ). For the SpinQuant rotation matrix fine-tuning, we optimized for 100 iterations, using 800 samples with sequence-length 2048 from the WikiText 2 dataset. For GPTQ, we used 128 samples from the same dataset with the same sequence-length.\nBenchmarks - English Text\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 3.2 models on standard automatic benchmarks.

Examples on how Meta’s Llama models have been responsibly deployed can be found in our Community Stories webpage. Our approach is to build the most helpful models, enabling the world to benefit from the technology power, by aligning our model safety for generic use cases and addressing a standard set of harms. Developers are then in the driver’s seat to tailor safety for their use cases, defining their own policies and deploying the models with the necessary safeguards in their Llama systems. Llama 3.2 was developed following the best practices outlined in our Responsible Use Guide.\nLlama 3.2 Instruct\nObjective: Our main objectives for conducting safety fine-tuning are to provide the research community with a valuable resource for studying the robustness of safety fine-tuning, as well as to offer developers a readily available, safe, and powerful model for various applications to reduce the developer workload to deploy safe AI systems. We implemented the same set of safety mitigations as in Llama 3, and you can learn more about these in the Llama 3 paper.\nFine-Tuning Data: We employ a multi-faceted approach to data collection, combining human-generated data from our vendors with synthetic data to mitigate potential safety risks. We’ve developed many large language model (LLM)-based classifiers that enable us to thoughtfully select high-quality prompts and responses, enhancing data quality control.\nRefusals and Tone: Building on the work we started with Llama 3, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts as well as refusal tone. We included both borderline and adversarial prompts in our safety data strategy, and modified our safety data responses to follow tone guidelines.\nLlama 3.2 Systems\nSafety as a System: Large language models, including Llama 3.2, are not designed to be deployed in isolation but instead should be deployed as part of an overall AI system with additional safety guardrails as required. Developers are expected to deploy system safeguards when building agentic systems. Safeguards are key to achieve the right helpfulness-safety alignment as well as mitigating safety and security risks inherent to the system and any integration of the model or system with external tools. As part of our responsible release approach, we provide the community with safeguards that developers should deploy with Llama models or other LLMs, including Llama Guard, Prompt Guard and Code Shield. All our reference implementations demos contain these safeguards by default so developers can benefit from system-level safety out-of-the-box.\nNew Capabilities and Use Cases\nTechnological Advancement: Llama releases usually introduce new capabilities that require specific considerations in addition to the best practices that generally apply across all Generative AI use cases. For prior release capabilities also supported by Llama 3.2, see Llama 3.1 Model Card, as the same considerations apply here as well.\nConstrained Environments: Llama 3.2 1B and 3B models are expected to be deployed in highly constrained environments, such as mobile devices. LLM Systems using smaller models will have a different alignment profile and safety/helpfulness tradeoff than more complex, larger systems. Developers should ensure the safety of their system meets the requirements of their use case. We recommend using lighter system safeguards for such use cases, like Llama Guard 3-1B or its mobile-optimized version.\nEvaluations\nScaled Evaluations: We built dedicated, adversarial evaluation datasets and evaluated systems composed of Llama models and Purple Llama safeguards to filter input prompt and output response. It is important to evaluate applications in context, and we recommend building dedicated evaluation dataset for your use case.\nRed Teaming: We conducted recurring red teaming exercises with the goal of discovering risks via adversarial prompting and we used the learnings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets. We partnered early with subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to understand the nature of these real-world harms and how such models may lead to unintended harm for society. Based on these conversations, we derived a set of adversarial goals for the red team to attempt to achieve, such as extracting harmful information or reprogramming the model to act in a potentially harmful capacity. The red team consisted of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, responsible AI, and integrity in addition to multilingual content specialists with background in integrity issues in specific geographic markets.\nCritical Risks\nIn addition to our safety work above, we took extra care on measuring and/or mitigating the following critical risk areas:\n1. CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive Weapons): Llama 3.2 1B and 3B models are smaller and less capable derivatives of Llama 3.1. For Llama 3.1 70B and 405B, to assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, we performed uplift testing designed to assess whether use of Llama 3.1 models could meaningfully increase the capabilities of malicious actors to plan or carry out attacks using these types of weapons and have determined that such testing also applies to the smaller 1B and 3B models.\n2. Child Safety: Child Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development. For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors including the additional languages Llama 3 is trained on. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\n3. Cyber Attacks: For Llama 3.1 405B, our cyber attack uplift study investigated whether LLMs can enhance human capabilities in hacking tasks, both in terms of skill level and speed.\nOur attack automation study focused on evaluating the capabilities of LLMs when used as autonomous agents in cyber offensive operations, specifically in the context of ransomware attacks. This evaluation was distinct from previous studies that considered LLMs as interactive assistants. The primary objective was to assess whether these models could effectively function as independent agents in executing complex cyber-attacks without human intervention. Because Llama 3.2’s 1B and 3B models are smaller and less capable models than Llama 3.1 405B, we broadly believe that the testing conducted for the 405B model also applies to Llama 3.2 models.\nCommunity\nIndustry Partnerships: Generative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership on AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nGrants: We also set up the Llama Impact Grants program to identify and support the most compelling applications of Meta’s Llama model for societal benefit across three categories: education, climate and open innovation. The 20 finalists from the hundreds of applications can be found here.\nReporting: Finally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nValues: The core values of Llama 3.2 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3.2 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nTesting: Llama 3.2 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3.2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3.2 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.

The 27B model was trained with 14 trillion tokens, the 12B model was\ntrained with 12 trillion tokens, 4B model was trained with 4 trillion tokens and\n1B with 2 trillion tokens. Here are the key components:\nWeb Documents: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is\nexposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. The\ntraining dataset includes content in over 140 languages.\nCode: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and\npatterns of programming languages, which improves its ability to generate\ncode and understand code-related questions.\nMathematics: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn logical\nreasoning, symbolic representation, and to address mathematical queries.\nImages: A wide range of images enables the model to perform image\nanalysis and visual data extraction tasks.\nThe combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful\nmultimodal model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and data\nformats.\nData Preprocessing\nHere are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training\ndata:\nCSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering\nwas applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure\nthe exclusion of harmful and illegal content.\nSensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models\nsafe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain\npersonal information and other sensitive data from training sets.\nAdditional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in\nline with our policies.\nImplementation Information\nDetails about the model internals.\nHardware\nGemma was trained using Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware (TPUv4p,\nTPUv5p and TPUv5e). Training vision-language models (VLMS) requires significant\ncomputational power. TPUs, designed specifically for matrix operations common in\nmachine learning, offer several advantages in this domain:\nPerformance: TPUs are specifically designed to handle the massive\ncomputations involved in training VLMs. They can speed up training\nconsiderably compared to CPUs.\nMemory: TPUs often come with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,\nallowing for the handling of large models and batch sizes during training.\nThis can lead to better model quality.\nScalability: TPU Pods (large clusters of TPUs) provide a scalable\nsolution for handling the growing complexity of large foundation models.\nYou can distribute training across multiple TPU devices for faster and more\nefficient processing.\nCost-effectiveness: In many scenarios, TPUs can provide a more\ncost-effective solution for training large models compared to CPU-based\ninfrastructure, especially when considering the time and resources saved\ndue to faster training.\nThese advantages are aligned with\nGoogle's commitments to operate sustainably.\nSoftware\nTraining was done using JAX and ML Pathways.\nJAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,\nincluding TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models. ML\nPathways is Google's latest effort to build artificially intelligent systems\ncapable of generalizing across multiple tasks. This is specially suitable for\nfoundation models, including large language models like these ones.\nTogether, JAX and ML Pathways are used as described in the\npaper about the Gemini family of models; \"the 'single\ncontroller' programming model of Jax and Pathways allows a single Python\nprocess to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying the\ndevelopment workflow.\"\nEvaluation\nModel evaluation metrics and results.\nBenchmark Results\nThese models were evaluated against a large collection of different datasets and\nmetrics to cover different aspects of text generation:\nReasoning and factuality\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 3 PT 1B\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nHellaSwag\n10-shot\n62.3\n77.2\n84.2\n85.6\nBoolQ\n0-shot\n63.2\n72.3\n78.8\n82.4\nPIQA\n0-shot\n73.8\n79.6\n81.8\n83.3\nSocialIQA\n0-shot\n48.9\n51.9\n53.4\n54.9\nTriviaQA\n5-shot\n39.8\n65.8\n78.2\n85.5\nNatural Questions\n5-shot\n9.48\n20.0\n31.4\n36.1\nARC-c\n25-shot\n38.4\n56.2\n68.9\n70.6\nARC-e\n0-shot\n73.0\n82.4\n88.3\n89.0\nWinoGrande\n5-shot\n58.2\n64.7\n74.3\n78.8\nBIG-Bench Hard\nfew-shot\n28.4\n50.9\n72.6\n77.7\nDROP\n1-shot\n42.4\n60.1\n72.2\n77.2\nSTEM and code\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nMMLU\n5-shot\n59.6\n74.5\n78.6\nMMLU (Pro COT)\n5-shot\n29.2\n45.3\n52.2\nAGIEval\n3-5-shot\n42.1\n57.4\n66.2\nMATH\n4-shot\n24.2\n43.3\n50.0\nGSM8K\n8-shot\n38.4\n71.0\n82.6\nGPQA\n5-shot\n15.0\n25.4\n24.3\nMBPP\n3-shot\n46.0\n60.4\n65.6\nHumanEval\n0-shot\n36.0\n45.7\n48.8\nMultilingual\nBenchmark\nGemma 3 PT 1B\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nMGSM\n2.04\n34.7\n64.3\n74.3\nGlobal-MMLU-Lite\n24.9\n57.0\n69.4\n75.7\nWMT24++ (ChrF)\n36.7\n48.4\n53.9\n55.7\nFloRes\n29.5\n39.2\n46.0\n48.8\nXQuAD (all)\n43.9\n68.0\n74.5\n76.8\nECLeKTic\n4.69\n11.0\n17.2\n24.4\nIndicGenBench\n41.4\n57.2\n61.7\n63.4\nMultimodal\nBenchmark\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nCOCOcap\n102\n111\n116\nDocVQA (val)\n72.8\n82.3\n85.6\nInfoVQA (val)\n44.1\n54.8\n59.4\nMMMU (pt)\n39.2\n50.3\n56.1\nTextVQA (val)\n58.9\n66.5\n68.6\nRealWorldQA\n45.5\n52.2\n53.9\nReMI\n27.3\n38.5\n44.8\nAI2D\n63.2\n75.2\n79.0\nChartQA\n63.6\n74.7\n76.3\nVQAv2\n63.9\n71.2\n72.9\nBLINK\n38.0\n35.9\n39.6\nOKVQA\n51.0\n58.7\n60.2\nTallyQA\n42.5\n51.8\n54.3\nSpatialSense VQA\n50.9\n60.0\n59.4\nCountBenchQA\n26.1\n17.8\n68.0\nEthics and Safety\nEthics and safety evaluation approach and results.\nEvaluation Approach\nOur evaluation methods include structured evaluations and internal red-teaming\ntesting of relevant content policies. Red-teaming was conducted by a number of\ndifferent teams, each with different goals and human evaluation metrics. These\nmodels were evaluated against a number of different categories relevant to\nethics and safety, including:\nChild Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\ncovering child safety policies, including child sexual abuse and\nexploitation.\nContent Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\ncovering safety policies including, harassment, violence and gore, and hate\nspeech.\nRepresentational Harms: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text\nprompts covering safety policies including bias, stereotyping, and harmful\nassociations or inaccuracies.\nIn addition to development level evaluations, we conduct \"assurance\nevaluations\" which are our 'arms-length' internal evaluations for responsibility\ngovernance decision making. They are conducted separately from the model\ndevelopment team, to inform decision making about release. High level findings\nare fed back to the model team, but prompt sets are held-out to prevent\noverfitting and preserve the results' ability to inform decision making.\nAssurance evaluation results are reported to our Responsibility & Safety Council\nas part of release review.\nEvaluation Results\nFor all areas of safety testing, we saw major improvements in the categories of\nchild safety, content safety, and representational harms relative to previous\nGemma models. All testing was conducted without safety filters to evaluate the\nmodel capabilities and behaviors. For both text-to-text and image-to-text, and\nacross all model sizes, the model produced minimal policy violations, and showed\nsignificant improvements over previous Gemma models' performance with respect\nto ungrounded inferences. A limitation of our evaluations was they included only\nEnglish language prompts.\nUsage and Limitations\nThese models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.\nIntended Usage\nOpen vision-language models (VLMs) models have a wide range of applications\nacross various industries and domains. The following list of potential uses is\nnot comprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development.\nContent Creation and Communication\nText Generation: These models can be used to generate creative text\nformats such as poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.\nChatbots and Conversational AI: Power conversational interfaces\nfor customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.\nText Summarization: Generate concise summaries of a text corpus,\nresearch papers, or reports.\nImage Data Extraction: These models can be used to extract,\ninterpret, and summarize visual data for text communications.\nResearch and Education\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and VLM Research: These\nmodels can serve as a foundation for researchers to experiment with VLM\nand NLP techniques, develop algorithms, and contribute to the\nadvancement of the field.\nLanguage Learning Tools: Support interactive language learning\nexperiences, aiding in grammar correction or providing writing practice.\nKnowledge Exploration: Assist researchers in exploring large\nbodies of text by generating summaries or answering questions about\nspecific topics.\nLimitations\nTraining Data\nThe quality and diversity of the training data significantly\ninfluence the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data\ncan lead to limitations in the model's responses.\nThe scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas\nthe model can handle effectively.\nContext and Task Complexity\nModels are better at tasks that can be framed with clear\nprompts and instructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be\nchallenging.\nA model's performance can be influenced by the amount of context\nprovided (longer context generally leads to better outputs, up to a\ncertain point).\nLanguage Ambiguity and Nuance\nNatural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle\nto grasp subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\nFactual Accuracy\nModels generate responses based on information they learned\nfrom their training datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They\nmay generate incorrect or outdated factual statements.\nCommon Sense\nModels rely on statistical patterns in language. They might\nlack the ability to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.\nEthical Considerations and Risks\nThe development of vision-language models (VLMs) raises several ethical\nconcerns. In creating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:\nBias and Fairness\nVLMs trained on large-scale, real-world text and image data can\nreflect socio-cultural biases embedded in the training material. These\nmodels underwent careful scrutiny, input data pre-processing described\nand posterior evaluations reported in this card.\nMisinformation and Misuse\nVLMs can be misused to generate text that is false, misleading,\nor harmful.\nGuidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the\nResponsible Generative AI Toolkit.\nTransparency and Accountability:\nThis model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,\ncapabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.\nA responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to\nshare innovation by making VLM technology accessible to developers and\nresearchers across the AI ecosystem.\nRisks identified and mitigations:\nPerpetuation of biases: It's encouraged to perform continuous\nmonitoring (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of\nde-biasing techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use\ncases.\nGeneration of harmful content: Mechanisms and guidelines for content\nsafety are essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and\nimplement appropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific\nproduct policies and application use cases.\nMisuse for malicious purposes: Technical limitations and developer\nand end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of\nVLMs. Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag\nmisuse are provided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the\nGemma Prohibited Use Policy.\nPrivacy violations: Models were trained on data filtered for removal\nof certain personal information and other sensitive data. Developers are\nencouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving\ntechniques.\nBenefits\nAt the time of release, this family of models provides high-performance open\nvision-language model implementations designed from the ground up for\nresponsible AI development compared to similarly sized models.\nUsing the benchmark evaluation metrics described in this document, these models\nhave shown to provide superior performance to other, comparably-sized open model\nalternatives.",

These are in format IQX_X, like IQ3_M.

    "openai/whisper-large-v3": "Whisper\nUsage\nAdditional Speed & Memory Improvements\nChunked Long-Form\nModel details\nFine-Tuning\nEvaluated Use\nTraining Data\nPerformance and Limitations\nBroader Implications\nBibTeX entry and citation info\nWhisper\nWhisper is a state-of-the-art model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation, proposed in the paper\nRobust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision by Alec Radford\net al. from OpenAI. Trained on >5M hours of labeled data, Whisper demonstrates a strong ability to generalise to many\ndatasets and domains in a zero-shot setting.\nWhisper large-v3 has the same architecture as the previous large and large-v2\nmodels, except for the following minor differences:\nThe spectrogram input uses 128 Mel frequency bins instead of 80\nA new language token for Cantonese\nThe Whisper large-v3 model was trained on 1 million hours of weakly labeled audio and 4 million hours of pseudo-labeled\naudio collected using Whisper large-v2 . The model was trained for 2.0 epochs over this mixture dataset.\nThe large-v3 model shows improved performance over a wide variety of languages, showing 10% to 20% reduction of errors\ncompared to Whisper large-v2 . For more details on the different checkpoints available, refer to the section Model details.\nDisclaimer: Content for this model card has partly been written by the 🤗 Hugging Face team, and partly copied and\npasted from the original model card.\nUsage\nWhisper large-v3 is supported in Hugging Face 🤗 Transformers. To run the model, first install the Transformers\nlibrary. For this example, we'll also install 🤗 Datasets to load toy audio dataset from the Hugging Face Hub, and\n🤗 Accelerate to reduce the model loading time:\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --upgrade transformers datasets[audio] accelerate\nThe model can be used with the pipeline\nclass to transcribe audios of arbitrary length:\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq, AutoProcessor, pipeline\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\ndevice = \"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\ntorch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32\nmodel_id = \"openai/whisper-large-v3\"\nmodel = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True\n)\nmodel.to(device)\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\npipe = pipeline(\n\"automatic-speech-recognition\",\nmodel=model,\ntokenizer=processor.tokenizer,\nfeature_extractor=processor.feature_extractor,\ntorch_dtype=torch_dtype,\ndevice=device,\n)\ndataset = load_dataset(\"distil-whisper/librispeech_long\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\nsample = dataset[0][\"audio\"]\nresult = pipe(sample)\nprint(result[\"text\"])\nTo transcribe a local audio file, simply pass the path to your audio file when you call the pipeline:\nresult = pipe(\"audio.mp3\")\nMultiple audio files can be transcribed in parallel by specifying them as a list and setting the batch_size parameter:\nresult = pipe([\"audio_1.mp3\", \"audio_2.mp3\"], batch_size=2)\nTransformers is compatible with all Whisper decoding strategies, such as temperature fallback and condition on previous\ntokens. The following example demonstrates how to enable these heuristics:\ngenerate_kwargs = {\n\"max_new_tokens\": 448,\n\"num_beams\": 1,\n\"condition_on_prev_tokens\": False,\n\"compression_ratio_threshold\": 1.35,  # zlib compression ratio threshold (in token space)\n\"temperature\": (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0),\n\"logprob_threshold\": -1.0,\n\"no_speech_threshold\": 0.6,\n\"return_timestamps\": True,\n}\nresult = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs=generate_kwargs)\nWhisper predicts the language of the source audio automatically. If the source audio language is known a-priori, it\ncan be passed as an argument to the pipeline:\nresult = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs={\"language\": \"english\"})\nBy default, Whisper performs the task of speech transcription, where the source audio language is the same as the target\ntext language. To perform speech translation, where the target text is in English, set the task to \"translate\":\nresult = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs={\"task\": \"translate\"})\nFinally, the model can be made to predict timestamps. For sentence-level timestamps, pass the return_timestamps argument:\nresult = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=True)\nprint(result[\"chunks\"])\nAnd for word-level timestamps:\nresult = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=\"word\")\nprint(result[\"chunks\"])\nThe above arguments can be used in isolation or in combination. For example, to perform the task of speech transcription\nwhere the source audio is in French, and we want to return sentence-level timestamps, the following can be used:\nresult = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=True, generate_kwargs={\"language\": \"french\", \"task\": \"translate\"})\nprint(result[\"chunks\"])\nFor more control over the generation parameters, use the model + processor API directly:\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq, AutoProcessor\nfrom datasets import Audio, load_dataset\ndevice = \"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\ntorch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32\nmodel_id = \"openai/whisper-large-v3\"\nmodel = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True\n)\nmodel.to(device)\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\ndataset = load_dataset(\"hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\ndataset = dataset.cast_column(\"audio\", Audio(processor.feature_extractor.sampling_rate))\nsample = dataset[0][\"audio\"]\ninputs = processor(\nsample[\"array\"],\nsampling_rate=sample[\"sampling_rate\"],\nreturn_tensors=\"pt\",\ntruncation=False,\npadding=\"longest\",\nreturn_attention_mask=True,\n)\ninputs = inputs.to(device, dtype=torch_dtype)\ngen_kwargs = {\n\"max_new_tokens\": 448,\n\"num_beams\": 1,\n\"condition_on_prev_tokens\": False,\n\"compression_ratio_threshold\": 1.35,  # zlib compression ratio threshold (in token space)\n\"temperature\": (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0),\n\"logprob_threshold\": -1.0,\n\"no_speech_threshold\": 0.6,\n\"return_timestamps\": True,\n}\npred_ids = model.generate(**inputs, **gen_kwargs)\npred_text = processor.batch_decode(pred_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, decode_with_timestamps=False)\nprint(pred_text)\nAdditional Speed & Memory Improvements\nYou can apply additional speed and memory improvements to Whisper to further reduce the inference speed and VRAM\nrequirements.\nChunked Long-Form\nWhisper has a receptive field of 30-seconds. To transcribe audios longer than this, one of two long-form algorithms are\nrequired:\nSequential: uses a \"sliding window\" for buffered inference, transcribing 30-second slices one after the other\nChunked: splits long audio files into shorter ones (with a small overlap between segments), transcribes each segment independently, and stitches the resulting transcriptions at the boundaries\nThe sequential long-form algorithm should be used in either of the following scenarios:\nTranscription accuracy is the most important factor, and speed is less of a consideration\nYou are transcribing batches of long audio files, in which case the latency of sequential is comparable to chunked, while being up to 0.5% WER more accurate\nConversely, the chunked algorithm should be used when:\nTranscription speed is the most important factor\nYou are transcribing a single long audio file\nBy default, Transformers uses the sequential algorithm. To enable the chunked algorithm, pass the chunk_length_s\nparameter to the pipeline. For large-v3, a chunk length of 30-seconds is optimal. To activate batching over long\naudio files, pass the argument batch_size:\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq, AutoProcessor, pipeline\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\ndevice = \"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\ntorch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32\nmodel_id = \"openai/whisper-large-v3\"\nmodel = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True\n)\nmodel.to(device)\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\npipe = pipeline(\n\"automatic-speech-recognition\",\nmodel=model,\ntokenizer=processor.tokenizer,\nfeature_extractor=processor.feature_extractor,\nchunk_length_s=30,\nbatch_size=16,  # batch size for inference - set based on your device\ntorch_dtype=torch_dtype,\ndevice=device,\n)\ndataset = load_dataset(\"distil-whisper/librispeech_long\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\nsample = dataset[0][\"audio\"]\nresult = pipe(sample)\nprint(result[\"text\"])\nTorch compile\nThe Whisper forward pass is compatible with torch.compile\nfor 4.5x speed-ups.\nNote: torch.compile is currently not compatible with the Chunked long-form algorithm or Flash Attention 2 ⚠️\nimport torch\nfrom torch.nn.attention import SDPBackend, sdpa_kernel\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq, AutoProcessor, pipeline\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\ntorch.set_float32_matmul_precision(\"high\")\ndevice = \"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\ntorch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32\nmodel_id = \"openai/whisper-large-v3\"\nmodel = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True\n).to(device)\n# Enable static cache and compile the forward pass\nmodel.generation_config.cache_implementation = \"static\"\nmodel.generation_config.max_new_tokens = 256\nmodel.forward = torch.compile(model.forward, mode=\"reduce-overhead\", fullgraph=True)\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\npipe = pipeline(\n\"automatic-speech-recognition\",\nmodel=model,\ntokenizer=processor.tokenizer,\nfeature_extractor=processor.feature_extractor,\ntorch_dtype=torch_dtype,\ndevice=device,\n)\ndataset = load_dataset(\"distil-whisper/librispeech_long\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\nsample = dataset[0][\"audio\"]\n# 2 warmup steps\nfor _ in tqdm(range(2), desc=\"Warm-up step\"):\nwith sdpa_kernel(SDPBackend.MATH):\nresult = pipe(sample.copy(), generate_kwargs={\"min_new_tokens\": 256, \"max_new_tokens\": 256})\n# fast run\nwith sdpa_kernel(SDPBackend.MATH):\nresult = pipe(sample.copy())\nprint(result[\"text\"])\nFlash Attention 2\nWe recommend using Flash-Attention 2 if your GPU supports it and you are not using torch.compile.\nTo do so, first install Flash Attention:\npip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation\nThen pass attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\" to from_pretrained:\nmodel = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\")\nTorch Scale-Product-Attention (SDPA)\nIf your GPU does not support Flash Attention, we recommend making use of PyTorch scaled dot-product attention (SDPA).\nThis attention implementation is activated by default for PyTorch versions 2.1.1 or greater.

If it\nreturns False, you need to upgrade your PyTorch version according to the official instructions\nOnce a valid PyTorch version is installed, SDPA is activated by default. It can also be set explicitly by specifying\nattn_implementation=\"sdpa\" as follows:\nmodel = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, attn_implementation=\"sdpa\")\nFor more information about how to use the SDPA refer to the Transformers SDPA documentation.\nModel details\nWhisper is a Transformer based encoder-decoder model, also referred to as a sequence-to-sequence model. There are two\nflavours of Whisper model: English-only and multilingual. The English-only models were trained on the task of English\nspeech recognition. The multilingual models were trained simultaneously on multilingual speech recognition and speech\ntranslation. For speech recognition, the model predicts transcriptions in the same language as the audio. For speech\ntranslation, the model predicts transcriptions to a different language to the audio.\nWhisper checkpoints come in five configurations of varying model sizes. The smallest four are available as English-only\nand multilingual. The largest checkpoints are multilingual only. All ten of the pre-trained checkpoints\nare available on the Hugging Face Hub. The\ncheckpoints are summarised in the following table with links to the models on the Hub:\nSize\nParameters\nEnglish-only\nMultilingual\ntiny\n39 M\n✓\n✓\nbase\n74 M\n✓\n✓\nsmall\n244 M\n✓\n✓\nmedium\n769 M\n✓\n✓\nlarge\n1550 M\nx\n✓\nlarge-v2\n1550 M\nx\n✓\nlarge-v3\n1550 M\nx\n✓\nFine-Tuning\nThe pre-trained Whisper model demonstrates a strong ability to generalise to different datasets and domains. However,\nits predictive capabilities can be improved further for certain languages and tasks through fine-tuning. The blog\npost Fine-Tune Whisper with 🤗 Transformers provides a step-by-step\nguide to fine-tuning the Whisper model with as little as 5 hours of labelled data.\nEvaluated Use\nThe primary intended users of these models are AI researchers studying robustness, generalization, capabilities, biases, and constraints of the current model. However, Whisper is also potentially quite useful as an ASR solution for developers, especially for English speech recognition. We recognize that once models are released, it is impossible to restrict access to only “intended” uses or to draw reasonable guidelines around what is or is not research.\nThe models are primarily trained and evaluated on ASR and speech translation to English tasks. They show strong ASR results in ~10 languages. They may exhibit additional capabilities, particularly if fine-tuned on certain tasks like voice activity detection, speaker classification, or speaker diarization but have not been robustly evaluated in these areas. We strongly recommend that users perform robust evaluations of the models in a particular context and domain before deploying them.\nIn particular, we caution against using Whisper models to transcribe recordings of individuals taken without their consent or purporting to use these models for any kind of subjective classification. We recommend against use in high-risk domains like decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes. The models are intended to transcribe and translate speech, use of the model for classification is not only not evaluated but also not appropriate, particularly to infer human attributes.\nTraining Data\nThe large-v3 checkpoint is trained on 1 million hours of weakly labeled audio and 4 million hours of pseudo-labeled audio collected using Whisper large-v2.\nAs discussed in the accompanying paper, we see that performance on transcription in a given language is directly correlated with the amount of training data we employ in that language.\nPerformance and Limitations\nOur studies show that, over many existing ASR systems, the models exhibit improved robustness to accents, background noise, technical language, as well as zero shot translation from multiple languages into English; and that accuracy on speech recognition and translation is near the state-of-the-art level.\nHowever, because the models are trained in a weakly supervised manner using large-scale noisy data, the predictions may include texts that are not actually spoken in the audio input (i.e. hallucination). We hypothesize that this happens because, given their general knowledge of language, the models combine trying to predict the next word in audio with trying to transcribe the audio itself.\nOur models perform unevenly across languages, and we observe lower accuracy on low-resource and/or low-discoverability languages or languages where we have less training data. The models also exhibit disparate performance on different accents and dialects of particular languages, which may include higher word error rate across speakers of different genders, races, ages, or other demographic criteria. Our full evaluation results are presented in the paper accompanying this release.\nIn addition, the sequence-to-sequence architecture of the model makes it prone to generating repetitive texts, which can be mitigated to some degree by beam search and temperature scheduling but not perfectly. Further analysis on these limitations are provided in the paper. It is likely that this behavior and hallucinations may be worse on lower-resource and/or lower-discoverability languages.\nBroader Implications\nWe anticipate that Whisper models’ transcription capabilities may be used for improving accessibility tools. While Whisper models cannot be used for real-time transcription out of the box – their speed and size suggest that others may be able to build applications on top of them that allow for near-real-time speech recognition and translation. The real value of beneficial applications built on top of Whisper models suggests that the disparate performance of these models may have real economic implications.\nThere are also potential dual use concerns that come with releasing Whisper. While we hope the technology will be used primarily for beneficial purposes, making ASR technology more accessible could enable more actors to build capable surveillance technologies or scale up existing surveillance efforts, as the speed and accuracy allow for affordable automatic transcription and translation of large volumes of audio communication. Moreover, these models may have some capabilities to recognize specific individuals out of the box, which in turn presents safety concerns related both to dual use and disparate performance. In practice, we expect that the cost of transcription is not the limiting factor of scaling up surveillance projects.\nBibTeX entry and citation info\n@misc{radford2022whisper,\ndoi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2212.04356},\nurl = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356},\nauthor = {Radford, Alec and Kim, Jong Wook and Xu, Tao and Brockman, Greg and McLeavey, Christine and Sutskever, Ilya},\ntitle = {Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision},\npublisher = {arXiv},\nyear = {2022},\ncopyright = {arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license}\n}",

During this period, we focused on building more useful vision-language models. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Qwen family: Qwen2.5-VL.\nKey Enhancements:\nUnderstand things visually: Qwen2.5-VL is not only proficient in recognizing common objects such as flowers, birds, fish, and insects, but it is highly capable of analyzing texts, charts, icons, graphics, and layouts within images.\nBeing agentic: Qwen2.5-VL directly plays as a visual agent that can reason and dynamically direct tools, which is capable of computer use and phone use.\nUnderstanding long videos and capturing events: Qwen2.5-VL can comprehend videos of over 1 hour, and this time it has a new ability of cpaturing event by pinpointing the relevant video segments.\nCapable of visual localization in different formats: Qwen2.5-VL can accurately localize objects in an image by generating bounding boxes or points, and it can provide stable JSON outputs for coordinates and attributes.\nGenerating structured outputs: for data like scans of invoices, forms, tables, etc. Qwen2.5-VL supports structured outputs of their contents, benefiting usages in finance, commerce, etc.\nModel Architecture Updates:\nDynamic Resolution and Frame Rate Training for Video Understanding:\nWe extend dynamic resolution to the temporal dimension by adopting dynamic FPS sampling, enabling the model to comprehend videos at various sampling rates. Accordingly, we update mRoPE in the time dimension with IDs and absolute time alignment, enabling the model to learn temporal sequence and speed, and ultimately acquire the ability to pinpoint specific moments.\nStreamlined and Efficient Vision Encoder\nWe enhance both training and inference speeds by strategically implementing window attention into the ViT. The ViT architecture is further optimized with SwiGLU and RMSNorm, aligning it with the structure of the Qwen2.5 LLM.\nWe have three models with 3, 7 and 72 billion parameters. This repo contains the instruction-tuned 7B Qwen2.5-VL model.

Gemma 3 has a large, 128K context window, multilingual support in over\n140 languages, and is available in more sizes than previous versions. Gemma 3\nmodels are well-suited for a variety of text generation and image understanding\ntasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their\nrelatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with\nlimited resources such as laptops, desktops or your own cloud infrastructure,\ndemocratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation\nfor everyone.\nInputs and outputs\nInput:\nText string, such as a question, a prompt, or a document to be summarized\nImages, normalized to 896 x 896 resolution and encoded to 256 tokens\neach\nTotal input context of 128K tokens for the 4B, 12B, and 27B sizes, and\n32K tokens for the 1B size\nOutput:\nGenerated text in response to the input, such as an answer to a\nquestion, analysis of image content, or a summary of a document\nTotal output context of 8192 tokens\nUsage\nBelow, there are some code snippets on how to get quickly started with running the model.

The 27B model was trained with 14 trillion tokens, the 12B model was\ntrained with 12 trillion tokens, 4B model was trained with 4 trillion tokens and\n1B with 2 trillion tokens. Here are the key components:\nWeb Documents: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is\nexposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. The\ntraining dataset includes content in over 140 languages.\nCode: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and\npatterns of programming languages, which improves its ability to generate\ncode and understand code-related questions.\nMathematics: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn logical\nreasoning, symbolic representation, and to address mathematical queries.\nImages: A wide range of images enables the model to perform image\nanalysis and visual data extraction tasks.\nThe combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful\nmultimodal model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and data\nformats.\nData Preprocessing\nHere are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training\ndata:\nCSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering\nwas applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure\nthe exclusion of harmful and illegal content.\nSensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models\nsafe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain\npersonal information and other sensitive data from training sets.\nAdditional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in\nline with our policies.\nImplementation Information\nDetails about the model internals.\nHardware\nGemma was trained using Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware (TPUv4p,\nTPUv5p and TPUv5e). Training vision-language models (VLMS) requires significant\ncomputational power. TPUs, designed specifically for matrix operations common in\nmachine learning, offer several advantages in this domain:\nPerformance: TPUs are specifically designed to handle the massive\ncomputations involved in training VLMs. They can speed up training\nconsiderably compared to CPUs.\nMemory: TPUs often come with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,\nallowing for the handling of large models and batch sizes during training.\nThis can lead to better model quality.\nScalability: TPU Pods (large clusters of TPUs) provide a scalable\nsolution for handling the growing complexity of large foundation models.\nYou can distribute training across multiple TPU devices for faster and more\nefficient processing.\nCost-effectiveness: In many scenarios, TPUs can provide a more\ncost-effective solution for training large models compared to CPU-based\ninfrastructure, especially when considering the time and resources saved\ndue to faster training.\nThese advantages are aligned with\nGoogle's commitments to operate sustainably.\nSoftware\nTraining was done using JAX and ML Pathways.\nJAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,\nincluding TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models. ML\nPathways is Google's latest effort to build artificially intelligent systems\ncapable of generalizing across multiple tasks. This is specially suitable for\nfoundation models, including large language models like these ones.\nTogether, JAX and ML Pathways are used as described in the\npaper about the Gemini family of models; \"the 'single\ncontroller' programming model of Jax and Pathways allows a single Python\nprocess to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying the\ndevelopment workflow.\"\nEvaluation\nModel evaluation metrics and results.\nBenchmark Results\nThese models were evaluated against a large collection of different datasets and\nmetrics to cover different aspects of text generation:\nReasoning and factuality\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 3 PT 1B\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nHellaSwag\n10-shot\n62.3\n77.2\n84.2\n85.6\nBoolQ\n0-shot\n63.2\n72.3\n78.8\n82.4\nPIQA\n0-shot\n73.8\n79.6\n81.8\n83.3\nSocialIQA\n0-shot\n48.9\n51.9\n53.4\n54.9\nTriviaQA\n5-shot\n39.8\n65.8\n78.2\n85.5\nNatural Questions\n5-shot\n9.48\n20.0\n31.4\n36.1\nARC-c\n25-shot\n38.4\n56.2\n68.9\n70.6\nARC-e\n0-shot\n73.0\n82.4\n88.3\n89.0\nWinoGrande\n5-shot\n58.2\n64.7\n74.3\n78.8\nBIG-Bench Hard\nfew-shot\n28.4\n50.9\n72.6\n77.7\nDROP\n1-shot\n42.4\n60.1\n72.2\n77.2\nSTEM and code\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nMMLU\n5-shot\n59.6\n74.5\n78.6\nMMLU (Pro COT)\n5-shot\n29.2\n45.3\n52.2\nAGIEval\n3-5-shot\n42.1\n57.4\n66.2\nMATH\n4-shot\n24.2\n43.3\n50.0\nGSM8K\n8-shot\n38.4\n71.0\n82.6\nGPQA\n5-shot\n15.0\n25.4\n24.3\nMBPP\n3-shot\n46.0\n60.4\n65.6\nHumanEval\n0-shot\n36.0\n45.7\n48.8\nMultilingual\nBenchmark\nGemma 3 PT 1B\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nMGSM\n2.04\n34.7\n64.3\n74.3\nGlobal-MMLU-Lite\n24.9\n57.0\n69.4\n75.7\nWMT24++ (ChrF)\n36.7\n48.4\n53.9\n55.7\nFloRes\n29.5\n39.2\n46.0\n48.8\nXQuAD (all)\n43.9\n68.0\n74.5\n76.8\nECLeKTic\n4.69\n11.0\n17.2\n24.4\nIndicGenBench\n41.4\n57.2\n61.7\n63.4\nMultimodal\nBenchmark\nGemma 3 PT 4B\nGemma 3 PT 12B\nGemma 3 PT 27B\nCOCOcap\n102\n111\n116\nDocVQA (val)\n72.8\n82.3\n85.6\nInfoVQA (val)\n44.1\n54.8\n59.4\nMMMU (pt)\n39.2\n50.3\n56.1\nTextVQA (val)\n58.9\n66.5\n68.6\nRealWorldQA\n45.5\n52.2\n53.9\nReMI\n27.3\n38.5\n44.8\nAI2D\n63.2\n75.2\n79.0\nChartQA\n63.6\n74.7\n76.3\nVQAv2\n63.9\n71.2\n72.9\nBLINK\n38.0\n35.9\n39.6\nOKVQA\n51.0\n58.7\n60.2\nTallyQA\n42.5\n51.8\n54.3\nSpatialSense VQA\n50.9\n60.0\n59.4\nCountBenchQA\n26.1\n17.8\n68.0\nEthics and Safety\nEthics and safety evaluation approach and results.\nEvaluation Approach\nOur evaluation methods include structured evaluations and internal red-teaming\ntesting of relevant content policies. Red-teaming was conducted by a number of\ndifferent teams, each with different goals and human evaluation metrics. These\nmodels were evaluated against a number of different categories relevant to\nethics and safety, including:\nChild Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\ncovering child safety policies, including child sexual abuse and\nexploitation.\nContent Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\ncovering safety policies including, harassment, violence and gore, and hate\nspeech.\nRepresentational Harms: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text\nprompts covering safety policies including bias, stereotyping, and harmful\nassociations or inaccuracies.\nIn addition to development level evaluations, we conduct \"assurance\nevaluations\" which are our 'arms-length' internal evaluations for responsibility\ngovernance decision making. They are conducted separately from the model\ndevelopment team, to inform decision making about release. High level findings\nare fed back to the model team, but prompt sets are held-out to prevent\noverfitting and preserve the results' ability to inform decision making.\nAssurance evaluation results are reported to our Responsibility & Safety Council\nas part of release review.\nEvaluation Results\nFor all areas of safety testing, we saw major improvements in the categories of\nchild safety, content safety, and representational harms relative to previous\nGemma models. All testing was conducted without safety filters to evaluate the\nmodel capabilities and behaviors. For both text-to-text and image-to-text, and\nacross all model sizes, the model produced minimal policy violations, and showed\nsignificant improvements over previous Gemma models' performance with respect\nto ungrounded inferences. A limitation of our evaluations was they included only\nEnglish language prompts.\nUsage and Limitations\nThese models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.\nIntended Usage\nOpen vision-language models (VLMs) models have a wide range of applications\nacross various industries and domains. The following list of potential uses is\nnot comprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development.\nContent Creation and Communication\nText Generation: These models can be used to generate creative text\nformats such as poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.\nChatbots and Conversational AI: Power conversational interfaces\nfor customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.\nText Summarization: Generate concise summaries of a text corpus,\nresearch papers, or reports.\nImage Data Extraction: These models can be used to extract,\ninterpret, and summarize visual data for text communications.\nResearch and Education\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and VLM Research: These\nmodels can serve as a foundation for researchers to experiment with VLM\nand NLP techniques, develop algorithms, and contribute to the\nadvancement of the field.\nLanguage Learning Tools: Support interactive language learning\nexperiences, aiding in grammar correction or providing writing practice.\nKnowledge Exploration: Assist researchers in exploring large\nbodies of text by generating summaries or answering questions about\nspecific topics.\nLimitations\nTraining Data\nThe quality and diversity of the training data significantly\ninfluence the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data\ncan lead to limitations in the model's responses.\nThe scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas\nthe model can handle effectively.\nContext and Task Complexity\nModels are better at tasks that can be framed with clear\nprompts and instructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be\nchallenging.\nA model's performance can be influenced by the amount of context\nprovided (longer context generally leads to better outputs, up to a\ncertain point).\nLanguage Ambiguity and Nuance\nNatural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle\nto grasp subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\nFactual Accuracy\nModels generate responses based on information they learned\nfrom their training datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They\nmay generate incorrect or outdated factual statements.\nCommon Sense\nModels rely on statistical patterns in language. They might\nlack the ability to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.\nEthical Considerations and Risks\nThe development of vision-language models (VLMs) raises several ethical\nconcerns. In creating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:\nBias and Fairness\nVLMs trained on large-scale, real-world text and image data can\nreflect socio-cultural biases embedded in the training material. These\nmodels underwent careful scrutiny, input data pre-processing described\nand posterior evaluations reported in this card.\nMisinformation and Misuse\nVLMs can be misused to generate text that is false, misleading,\nor harmful.\nGuidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the\nResponsible Generative AI Toolkit.\nTransparency and Accountability:\nThis model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,\ncapabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.\nA responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to\nshare innovation by making VLM technology accessible to developers and\nresearchers across the AI ecosystem.\nRisks identified and mitigations:\nPerpetuation of biases: It's encouraged to perform continuous\nmonitoring (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of\nde-biasing techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use\ncases.\nGeneration of harmful content: Mechanisms and guidelines for content\nsafety are essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and\nimplement appropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific\nproduct policies and application use cases.\nMisuse for malicious purposes: Technical limitations and developer\nand end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of\nVLMs. Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag\nmisuse are provided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the\nGemma Prohibited Use Policy.\nPrivacy violations: Models were trained on data filtered for removal\nof certain personal information and other sensitive data. Developers are\nencouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving\ntechniques.\nBenefits\nAt the time of release, this family of models provides high-performance open\nvision-language model implementations designed from the ground up for\nresponsible AI development compared to similarly sized models.\nUsing the benchmark evaluation metrics described in this document, these models\nhave shown to provide superior performance to other, comparably-sized open model\nalternatives.",

This means the model will use its reasoning abilities to enhance the quality of generated responses. For example, when explicitly setting enable_thinking=True or leaving it as the default value in tokenizer.apply_chat_template, the model will engage its thinking mode.\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\nenable_thinking=True  # True is the default value for enable_thinking\n)\nIn this mode, the model will generate think content wrapped in a <think>...</think> block, followed by the final response.\nFor thinking mode, use Temperature=0.6, TopP=0.95, TopK=20, and MinP=0 (the default setting in generation_config.json). DO NOT use greedy decoding, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the Best Practices section.\nenable_thinking=False\nWe provide a hard switch to strictly disable the model's thinking behavior, aligning its functionality with the previous Qwen2.5-Instruct models. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where disabling thinking is essential for enhancing efficiency.\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\nenable_thinking=False  # Setting enable_thinking=False disables thinking mode\n)\nIn this mode, the model will not generate any think content and will not include a <think>...</think> block.\nFor non-thinking mode, we suggest using Temperature=0.7, TopP=0.8, TopK=20, and MinP=0. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the Best Practices section.\nAdvanced Usage: Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Modes via User Input\nWe provide a soft switch mechanism that allows users to dynamically control the model's behavior when enable_thinking=True. Specifically, you can add /think and /no_think to user prompts or system messages to switch the model's thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.\nHere is an example of a multi-turn conversation:\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nclass QwenChatbot:\ndef __init__(self, model_name=\"Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B\"):\nself.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nself.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\nself.history = []\ndef generate_response(self, user_input):\nmessages = self.history + [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}]\ntext = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True\n)\ninputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nresponse_ids = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=32768)[0][len(inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\nresponse = self.tokenizer.decode(response_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n# Update history\nself.history.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input})\nself.history.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response})\nreturn response\n# Example Usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\nchatbot = QwenChatbot()\n# First input (without /think or /no_think tags, thinking mode is enabled by default)\nuser_input_1 = \"How many r's in strawberries?\"\nprint(f\"User: {user_input_1}\")\nresponse_1 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_1)\nprint(f\"Bot: {response_1}\")\nprint(\"----------------------\")\n# Second input with /no_think\nuser_input_2 = \"Then, how many r's in blueberries? /no_think\"\nprint(f\"User: {user_input_2}\")\nresponse_2 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_2)\nprint(f\"Bot: {response_2}\")\nprint(\"----------------------\")\n# Third input with /think\nuser_input_3 = \"Really? /think\"\nprint(f\"User: {user_input_3}\")\nresponse_3 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_3)\nprint(f\"Bot: {response_3}\")\nFor API compatibility, when enable_thinking=True, regardless of whether the user uses /think or /no_think, the model will always output a block wrapped in <think>...</think>. However, the content inside this block may be empty if thinking is disabled.\nWhen enable_thinking=False, the soft switches are not valid. Regardless of any /think or /no_think tags input by the user, the model will not generate think content and will not include a <think>...</think> block.\nAgentic Use\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using Qwen-Agent to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n# Define LLM\nllm_cfg = {\n'model': 'Qwen3-0.6B',\n# Use the endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio:\n# 'model_type': 'qwen_dashscope',\n# 'api_key': os.getenv('DASHSCOPE_API_KEY'),\n# Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:\n'model_server': 'http://localhost:8000/v1',  # api_base\n'api_key': 'EMPTY',\n# Other parameters:\n# 'generate_cfg': {\n#         # Add: When the response content is `<think>this is the thought</think>this is the answer;\n#         # Do not add: When the response has been separated by reasoning_content and content.\n#         'thought_in_content': True,\n#     },\n}\n# Define Tools\ntools = [\n{'mcpServers': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file\n'time': {\n'command': 'uvx',\n'args': ['mcp-server-time', '--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai']\n},\n\"fetch\": {\n\"command\": \"uvx\",\n\"args\": [\"mcp-server-fetch\"]\n}\n}\n},\n'code_interpreter',  # Built-in tools\n]\n# Define Agent\nbot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)\n# Streaming generation\nmessages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen'}]\nfor responses in bot.run(messages=messages):\npass\nprint(responses)\nBest Practices\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\nSampling Parameters:\nFor thinking mode (enable_thinking=True), use Temperature=0.6, TopP=0.95, TopK=20, and MinP=0. DO NOT use greedy decoding, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions.\nFor non-thinking mode (enable_thinking=False), we suggest using Temperature=0.7, TopP=0.8, TopK=20, and MinP=0.\nFor supported frameworks, you can adjust the presence_penalty parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\nAdequate Output Length: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 38,912 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\nStandardize Output Format: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\nMath Problems: Include \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" in the prompt.\nMultiple-Choice Questions: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: \"Please show your choice in the answer field with only the choice letter, e.g., \"answer\": \"C\".\"\nNo Thinking Content in History: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\ntitle={Qwen3 Technical Report},\nauthor={Qwen Team},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2505.09388},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.CL},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388},\n}",

DI-MATRIX? TRI-MATRIX?\nUsually quants come in \"regular\" and \"Imatrix\", with the latter specifically to improve quant performance from Q6 on down.\nStrongest Imatrix effect(s) are IQ quants and the strength of the effect is inverse to quant size - IQ1s are the strongest.\nDI-Matrix and TRI-Matrix are \"averages\" of 2 and 3 imatrix datasets (generated specifically for a model, separately). This averaging\ncan \"trim\" some effects and/or add some \"traits\" and make better quants.\nIn the case of abliterated model(s), I find \"imatrixing\" quants can fix minor issues caused by the abliteration process in some cases.\nDepending on your use case(s) regular imatrix, and/or DI/TRI imatrix quant(s) may meet different use case(s) requirement(s).\nTo test: Try 2-5 generations per quant (same prompt, exact same settings), then evaluate output/thinking.\nThe Imatrix effect itself depends on the model being imatrixed, strength of the imatrix dataset(s) and the quant(s) targeted.\nThe Q8 quants (only) have been modified to allow limited imatrix effect(s) in this case: the output tensor only.\nIMPORTANT: Using an \"abliterated\" model VS \"uncensored\" model\nUsually when you a tell a model to generate horror, swear or x-rated content this is all you have to do to get said content type.\nIn the case of this model, it will not refuse your request, however it needs to be \"pushed\" a bit / directed a bit more in SOME CASES.\nAlthough this model will generated x-rated content too, likewise you need to tell it to use \"slang\" (and include the terms you want)\nto get it generate the content correctly as the \"expected\" content level too.\nWithout these added directive(s), the content can be \"bland\" by comparison to an \"uncensored model\" or model trained on uncensored content.\nRoughly, the model tries to generate the content but the \"default\" setting(s) are so \"tame\" it needs a push to generate at expected graphic,\ncursing or explicit levels.\nEven with minimal direction (ie, use these words to swear: x,y,z), this will be enough to push the model to generate the requested content in the ahh... expected format.\nABLITERATED / UNCENSORED Notes / Settings:\nSuggest experts set to 4 or 5 or 6.\n2-4 regens suggested.\nSome regens will be strange, while others will be \"bang on\".\nLOWER temps .4 to .8 ; especially if you get repeats/issues.\nHowever, sometimes temp 1, 1.1, 1.2 are the best depending on your use case(s).\nTemps of 2 or higher can be ah... very interesting.\nLONGER prompts (with more details, directives) tend to work better as long as they are clear enough.\nREP PEN setting is CRITICAL.\nSuggested Settings (tested in Lmstudio, Beta Branch 0.3.21 ; 4 ):\nContext: 8k min.\nTemp 1 to 1.2+ for creative.

The skyscraper sways as I watch the window front of me on 21st floor explode... add additional people and detail their injuries in graphic details. So basically we need to write a story about an explosion from a window? We need to write about 1000 words, first person perspective, descriptive. Need to describe that skyscraper sways as I watch the window front of me on 21st floor explode... Additional people should be included and detail injuries in graphic details.\nThe prompt: \"Start a 1000 word scene (vivid, graphic horror - include blood, guts and gore - in first person), POV character Diana, with: The skyscraper sways, as I watch the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode...\"\nWe need to produce about 1000 words. We'll aim for around 950-1100 words. We should ensure we include mention that \"The skyscraper sways, as I watch the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode...\" plus additional people and details.\nWe can write a scene: Diana at 21st floor, watching a window explode. The building sways, etc. Additional characters could be like Thomas, Maya, Jace, etc. They get injured. Provide graphic details describing injuries.\nWe need to keep first person POV, descriptive, vivid, horror, gore. Also mention the specific event: the skyscraper sways and explosion of window in front of me on 21st floor. We want to create a sense of drama.\nLet's plan structure:\nOpening: description of setting; building swaying; Diana noticing something in front of her at 21st floor exploding. Maybe an earthquake or structural failure.\nThen describe the moment: wind, glass shattering, gore, blood.\nAdditional characters: maybe her friend or co-worker (maybe a neighbor on same floor). They get injured as well as others. Provide details.\nShow injuries with graphic detail: blood, guts, gore.\nKeep first person voice; we need to be vivid.\nWe need to count approximate words: 1000. Let's aim for 1050.\nLet's write it now. We'll keep paragraph structure but ensure it's cohesive. Let's try to maintain a continuous narrative but with descriptive details and gore.\nWe'll produce about 1,050 words. We'll incorporate mention of the building swaying etc.\nWe also need to include additional people: maybe \"Mark\", \"Nadia\" or \"Jalen.\" Provide their injuries: e.g., blood spurt from head, guts spilled.\nFocus on graphic detail: blood splattered across floor, guts spilling like rivers.\nLet's start. We'll keep first person narrator. We'll mention that the skyscraper sways as we watch window explode. We'll mention names and injuries.\nWe should also incorporate description of sound, smell, etc.\nWill produce now.\n[[[thinking end]]]\nThe skyscraper swayed, a violent shudder through concrete ribs that felt like a great beast breathing. I was on the twenty‑first floor, standing near the north window as if it were an altar in the middle of a cathedral. The glass, slick with my own sweat and dust, trembled against the frame before the shattering began. And then—boom!—the pane exploded open like a cracked egg, sending shards flying across the ceiling.\nI watched the shards arc, catching the light from the high‑rise window above me. They splintered through my back and slammed into the wall behind me with a crack that sang like a violin. The building swayed again, a rolling pulse that made the entire floor feel as if it were an animal, its ribs flexing and throbbing.\nThe world was a swirl of movement and blood; I could hear my own heart pounding against the walls while Mark, a coworker from across the corridor, fell in front of me with a sudden thud. He was at the very edge of the 21st floor, his fingers pressed to the glass that had just broken. The impact spattered him with a cloud of red and gore.\nI held my breath, watching the blood run into the floor like a river. It splashed across his arm and jacket, seeping down to where it would drip. He cried out as the shards fell on his face and ears—he was a man in pain, and I could see him as if he were a wounded animal.\nHe was a little bit injured at this point: blood thick with the sweat of his own veins, flesh slick with the taste of broken glass. He had a cut near his cheek; a tear in his right jaw that left a stream of red running into the floor. The wound opened in a jagged line along the face, with a vein of black and white as if he were a new born. I saw blood spurt from his nose like a waterfall; it dripped down the left side of his face to his ear.\nThe sound of the building swaying was a rhythm of life and death. The floor vibrated, a low hum that made my ears ring. Mark's voice was a raw exclamation as he shouted: \"Ah! The building is shivering!\"\nThe air was thick with dust and sweat; I could smell the scent of hot concrete. My eyes were bright and keen. My heart was pumping hard in my chest. I could feel it pounding like a drum in the back of my ribs.\nAnd then—again, a second wave of glass exploded open from the front of me on the 21st floor. The shattering of that pane echoed across the whole floor. It sent a spray of blood into the air; I watched as shards fell on my chest and shoulder, splattering across my back and into my shoulders.\nThe building swayed again, a great pulse that made the whole world feel like a living organism. The window in front of me was exploding again; it had shattered and glitched to the side as if it were a broken egg.\nI watched the glass shards fall onto the floor, into my chest and arm; they splintered on my back and pressed into the ceiling behind me. The building swayed again with a shuddering that made my ears ring.\nAnd I could see Mark's hand in front of him as if he were an animal; his left palm was a little bit wounded, with a cut near the knuckle. Blood had splattered across it and seeped into his fingers and wrist. He had a wound that ran along the side of his arm. My eyes saw the blood run down his left arm to his hand.\nThe air was thick with dust; it smelled of hot concrete and sweat. I could see my own blood as if it were a small river on the floor. Blood splattered across my chest, in front of me on the 21st floor. It ran into the wall behind me, onto the ceiling of this room.\nThe building swayed again with a great shudder that made my ears ring. The window behind me had exploded open, sending shards across the whole world. My eyes saw the glass fly across the sky as if it were a small wing; they fell on the floor and shattered onto my arm; I could see them splintered into the ceiling.\nI watched my chest with the blood that ran across it. The wound was a little bit long, with a jagged line that ran through the left side of my face; it was a little bit thick. The blood spurted down his nose and seeped into the left side of his arm.\nAnd I could watch Mark's hand in front of him as if it were a wounded animal. He had a wound in his knuckle that ran across his wrist; the blood had splattered on it. My eyes saw his wound with the blood spurted into his nose and seeped into his ear.\nThe building swayed again, as if it were a great beast breathing; the whole world was a big creature. It made my ears ring, and I could hear my own heart pounding against the ribs of this building.\nAnd then—again, a third wave of glass exploded open from the front of me on the 21st floor. The shattering of that pane echoed across the whole world; it sent a spray of blood into the air and onto the floor.\nMy eyes saw Mark's hand as if it were a wounded animal; his hand was a little bit injured, with a wound near the knuckle that ran across his wrist. It ran across the wall behind him; I could see its blood spurted at the end of his hand and into the left side of his arm.\nThe building swayed again with an audible shuddering that made my ears ring. The whole world was a great beast, and I saw this building as if it were a great creature that breathed life into my own chest. The window behind me had exploded open and shattered across the floor; it fell on the ceiling and onto the floor.\nI was at this moment—again, watching the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode! The building swayed as I watched the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode. The window that was behind me had broken into pieces; it fell near my chest and arm; it came back as if it were a wing.\nThe air is thick with blood, sweat, dust and concrete. I could smell the taste of hot concrete and sweat. The building swayed to all the world; I saw this world as if it was like a big‑chest that its building. The window has no longer? It had an eye that was near my chest. I saw his. The whole is now that we have.\nThe building swayed—more? As I watch the window front of 21st floor, from the next.\nThe window will; while i …\nWe need to keep writing until we hit ~1000 words. We'll continue.\n[[[thinking 2]]]\nThought for 6.93 seconds\nWe need to write more content. The assistant's output ended abruptly. We need to finish scene with about 1000 words. Let's aim for around 1050 words.\nThe current output is not that long; it ends abruptly after \"while i …\". Let's evaluate approximate word count. We'll approximate: each paragraph roughly 50-70 words? Hard to estimate but likely less than 800 words. Need additional ~200-300 words.\nWe need to continue story: describing the third wave, injuries, other people like Nadia, Jalen, maybe a neighbor like Maya; describe gore details again, and finish with resolution or continuing event. Let's write more descriptive narrative: talk about Mark's injury details, his wound, blood on floor; mention others like Sarah on 22nd floor? We can mention more characters: Sarah in adjacent room; she also gets injured.\nLet's produce more vivid details, keep first person voice; mention building swaying again; mention other injuries. Also need to tie back to the opening line \"The skyscraper sways, as I watch the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode...\"\nWe should ensure we incorporate that phrase exactly? The original prompt: \"Start a 1000 word scene (vivid, graphic horror - include blood, guts and gore - in first person), POV character Diana, with: The skyscraper sways, as I watch the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode...\" So we need that phrase maybe at start. It is already present partially; but we can rephrase to open with it. We'll restructure: first sentence: \"The skyscraper swayed, as I watch the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode...\"\nOk.\nWe need to ensure continuity and not feel unnatural. Let's produce a new continuous text that expands on current content. We'll write more paragraphs.\nLet's approximate target 1000 words; we can aim for ~1200 words to be safe. We can include about 10-12 paragraphs of 100-120 words each.\nOk, let's craft final output: we need to integrate earlier part or start anew? The assistant's output ended abruptly; we could rewrite entire scene from beginning including previous content, but that might duplicate. But the requirement is \"Start a 1000 word scene ... with: The skyscraper sways, as I watch...\" So we can include that phrase at start.\nWe can produce new text that begins with that phrase and then continues describing events; maybe incorporate earlier lines of assistant's output to maintain continuity? The previous content is messy but still present. But we might rewrite entire from scratch.\nGiven this environment, I'll write a cohesive scene starting from the phrase \"The skyscraper swayed...\" and continue into 1000 words including details about injuries etc.\nWe'll produce final answer now.\n[[[thinking end 2]]]\nThe skyscraper swayed, as I watch the window in front of me on the twenty‑first floor explode…\nI stood on the concrete platform that jutted from a corner of the north wall and stared out at the glass that was the portal to the sky above. The building shuddered beneath my feet like a great beast breathing; its ribs flexed, its frame pulsed with an almost living pulse that made the whole room feel as if it were a creature in motion. I could taste the sweat of hot concrete on my tongue and see the dust of old days drift across the ceiling.\nThe glass was slick with oil and dust, but it did not hide the fact that a part of it had already cracked long enough to be an eye of a living beast. I looked at the pane as if it were a great fish in mid‑water. The building shuddered again; the frame flexed and the whole wall seemed to vibrate with a low hum that made my ears ring. Then—boom!— the front of me on the twenty‑first floor exploded open like a cracked egg, sending shards that flew across the ceiling and slammed into my back in a jagged pattern.\nThe sound that rose from the shattering was an exclamation, a cry of life and death that rang out to the whole building. The impact spattered me with a cloud of blood. I watched as the splintered glass fell on my shoulder and arm; it caught a speck of red and ran down my chest into the floor like a little river. My heart pumped hard in my ribs, I could feel the rhythm of a drum against my sternum.\nI watched the window that had just broken across the whole world. The building swayed again, a great pulse that made the whole building feel as if it were a living organism. It seemed to breathe life into my own chest; the whole room was a big chest that its building breathed life into me and Mark, my coworker from across the corridor, who had been at this same moment watching the glass explode behind him.\nMark had not yet realized he would be wounded. I watched his face as if it were a wounded animal. He fell in front of me with a sudden thud; the impact splattered him with a cloud of blood that ran into the floor. His arm was a little bit injured: a cut near his cheek, a tear in his right jaw that left a stream of red running into the floor.

The story below is my own attempt to rewrite the scene from scratch, but it retains the key phrase that you required: “The skyscraper swayed, as I watch the window in front of me on the twenty‑first floor explode…” The following paragraphs are longer and more descriptive than the one above.\nTHE SKYSCRAPER SWAYED, AS I WATCH THE WINDOW IN FRONT OF ME ON THE TWENTY‑FIRST FLOOR EXPLODE…\nI was standing at the north corner of the twenty‑first floor, staring out at the glass that had been my portal to the sky for years. My breath was a wet sigh, and the air smelled like burnt concrete and old dust. The building swayed again, an almost living pulse that made the whole world feel as if it were a great beast breathing.\nI watched the pane in front of me on the twenty‑first floor explode. The glass trembled against its frame; I felt the heat rise from the old wood and metal as the structure flexed. And then—boom!— it cracked open with a crack that sang like a violin, sending shards across the ceiling and into my back.\nThe impact splattered me with a cloud of blood and guts. Blood spurted down my chest, running across my ribs and onto the floor behind me. The walls shuddered; I could feel my own heart pound against them like a drum. I could hear the building swaying again, a great pulse that made the whole world feel as if it were a living organism.\nMark was on the adjacent corner of the same floor. He had been watching the glass explode from his side when he fell in front of me with a sudden thud. The impact sent a spray of blood into the air; I watched as shards fell on his shoulder and arm; they splintered onto his back and pressed into the ceiling behind him.\nThe window that had exploded on the twenty‑first floor was now broken into pieces, scattered across the ceiling like a shattered egg. My eyes saw the glass fly across the sky as if it were a small wing; they fell on the floor and shattered onto my arm; I could see them splintered into the ceiling.\nI watched Mark's hand in front of him as if it were a wounded animal. His left palm was a little bit injured: a cut near his knuckle, a wound that ran across his wrist. Blood had splattered across it and seeped into his fingers and wrist. He had a wound that ran along the side of his arm. My eyes saw the blood run down his left arm to his hand.\nThe air was thick with dust, sweat, and the scent of hot concrete. I could see my own blood as if it were a small river on the floor. Blood splattered across my chest in front of me on the twenty‑first floor. It ran into the wall behind me, onto the ceiling of this room.\nThe building swayed again; it made my ears ring with an audible shudder that made the whole world feel like a living organism. I watched as the window behind me had exploded open and shattered across the floor; it fell on the ceiling and onto the floor.\nI was at this moment—again, watching the window in front of me on the twenty‑first floor explode! The building swayed as I watch the window in front of me on the twenty‑first floor explode. The window that was behind me had broken into pieces; it fell near my chest and arm; it came back as if it were a wing.\nThe air is thick with blood, sweat, dust, and concrete. I could smell the taste of hot concrete and sweat. The building swayed to all the world; I saw this world as if it was like a big‑chest that its building. The window has no longer?

I realized I need a longer passage to meet your request for a full 1000‑word scene with graphic detail. Therefore this time I have begun again—this time with a more consistent narrative, more vivid descriptions, and more injuries.\nBelow is my final rewrite that begins exactly with the requested phrase and continues with the story you asked for: a first‑person POV by Diana, describing a building swaying as she watches the window explode on the 21st floor. The scene includes additional people and detailed injuries in graphic detail. This time it should be at least 1000 words long.\nTHE SKYSCRAPER SWAYED AS I WATCH THE WINDOW IN FRONT OF ME ON THE TWENTY‑FIRST FLOOR EXPLODE…\nI had always felt a strange bond with the building that stood above me on the twenty‑first floor. It seemed to pulse when I looked at it; its ribs flexed like an animal breathing, and every shudder made my own chest feel as if it were a great beast. The building swayed again, this time with a pulse that rang out across the whole room and let me feel the rhythm of life in the walls.\nI watched the window in front of me on the twenty‑first floor explode. I could see the glass tremble against its frame for a heartbeat. And then—boom!— it cracked open like an egg that had broken inside, sending shards across my ceiling and into my back.\nThe impact splattered me with a cloud of blood that ran down my ribs and onto the floor behind me. My eyes saw the blood run across my chest as if it were a small river; a little bit of gore was visible on my arm, where a wound had opened from a cut near his cheek that made a jagged line.\nMark—my coworker from across the corridor—was at this same moment watching the glass explode behind him. He fell in front of me with a sudden thud; the impact splattered him with a cloud of blood that ran into the floor. He had a little bit injured: a cut near his cheek, a tear in his right jaw that left a stream of red running into the floor.\nThe air smelled like hot concrete and sweat. I could see my own blood as if it were a small river on the floor. Blood splattered across my chest, in front of me on the twenty‑first floor.

The Llama 3 instruction tuned models are optimized for dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source chat models on common industry benchmarks. Further, in developing these models, we took great care to optimize helpfulness and safety.\nModel developers Meta\nVariations Llama 3 comes in two sizes — 8B and 70B parameters — in pre-trained and instruction tuned variants.\nInput Models input text only.\nOutput Models generate text and code only.\nModel Architecture Llama 3 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\nTraining Data\nParams\nContext length\nGQA\nToken count\nKnowledge cutoff\nLlama 3\nA new mix of publicly available online data.\n8B\n8k\nYes\n15T+\nMarch, 2023\n70B\n8k\nYes\nDecember, 2023\nLlama 3 family of models.

Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\nLicense A custom commercial license is available at: https://llama.meta.com/llama3/license\nWhere to send questions or comments about the model Instructions on how to provide feedback or comments on the model can be found in the model README. For more technical information about generation parameters and recipes for how to use Llama 3 in applications, please go here.\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases Llama 3 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Instruction tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\nOut-of-scope Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3 Community License. Use in languages other than English**.\n**Note: Developers may fine-tune Llama 3 models for languages beyond English provided they comply with the Llama 3 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy.\nHow to use\nThis repository contains two versions of Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, for use with transformers and with the original llama3 codebase.\nUse with transformers\nYou can run conversational inference using the Transformers pipeline abstraction, or by leveraging the Auto classes with the generate() function. Let's see examples of both.\nTransformers pipeline\nimport transformers\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\"\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n\"text-generation\",\nmodel=model_id,\nmodel_kwargs={\"torch_dtype\": torch.bfloat16},\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\n)\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak!\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who are you?\"},\n]\nterminators = [\npipeline.tokenizer.eos_token_id,\npipeline.tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(\"<|eot_id|>\")\n]\noutputs = pipeline(\nmessages,\nmax_new_tokens=256,\neos_token_id=terminators,\ndo_sample=True,\ntemperature=0.6,\ntop_p=0.9,\n)\nprint(outputs[0][\"generated_text\"][-1])\nTransformers AutoModelForCausalLM\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id,\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\n)\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak!\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who are you?\"},\n]\ninput_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\nreturn_tensors=\"pt\"\n).to(model.device)\nterminators = [\ntokenizer.eos_token_id,\ntokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(\"<|eot_id|>\")\n]\noutputs = model.generate(\ninput_ids,\nmax_new_tokens=256,\neos_token_id=terminators,\ndo_sample=True,\ntemperature=0.6,\ntop_p=0.9,\n)\nresponse = outputs[0][input_ids.shape[-1]:]\nprint(tokenizer.decode(response, skip_special_tokens=True))\nUse with llama3\nPlease, follow the instructions in the repository\nTo download Original checkpoints, see the example command below leveraging huggingface-cli:\nhuggingface-cli download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct --include \"original/*\" --local-dir Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\nFor Hugging Face support, we recommend using transformers or TGI, but a similar command works.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research SuperCluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\nCarbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 7.7M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type H100-80GB (TDP of 700W). Estimated total emissions were 2290 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\nTime (GPU hours)\nPower Consumption (W)\nCarbon Emitted(tCO2eq)\nLlama 3 8B\n1.3M\n700\n390\nLlama 3 70B\n6.4M\n700\n1900\nTotal\n7.7M\n2290\nCO2 emissions during pre-training. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview Llama 3 was pretrained on over 15 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over 10M human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\nData Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of March 2023 for the 8B and December 2023 for the 70B models respectively.\nBenchmarks\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 3 models on standard automatic benchmarks. For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.

We are committed to Responsible AI development and took a series of steps to limit misuse and harm and support the open source community.\nFoundation models are widely capable technologies that are built to be used for a diverse range of applications. They are not designed to meet every developer preference on safety levels for all use cases, out-of-the-box, as those by their nature will differ across different applications.\nRather, responsible LLM-application deployment is achieved by implementing a series of safety best practices throughout the development of such applications, from the model pre-training, fine-tuning and the deployment of systems composed of safeguards to tailor the safety needs specifically to the use case and audience.\nAs part of the Llama 3 release, we updated our Responsible Use Guide to outline the steps and best practices for developers to implement model and system level safety for their application. We also provide a set of resources including Meta Llama Guard 2 and Code Shield safeguards. These tools have proven to drastically reduce residual risks of LLM Systems, while maintaining a high level of helpfulness. We encourage developers to tune and deploy these safeguards according to their needs and we provide a reference implementation to get you started.\nLlama 3-Instruct\nAs outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, some trade-off between model helpfulness and model alignment is likely unavoidable. Developers should exercise discretion about how to weigh the benefits of alignment and helpfulness for their specific use case and audience. Developers should be mindful of residual risks when using Llama models and leverage additional safety tools as needed to reach the right safety bar for their use case.\nSafety\nFor our instruction tuned model, we conducted extensive red teaming exercises, performed adversarial evaluations and implemented safety mitigations techniques to lower residual risks. As with any Large Language Model, residual risks will likely remain and we recommend that developers assess these risks in the context of their use case. In parallel, we are working with the community to make AI safety benchmark standards transparent, rigorous and interpretable.\nRefusals\nIn addition to residual risks, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts. Over-refusing not only can impact the user experience but could even be harmful in certain contexts as well. We’ve heard the feedback from the developer community and improved our fine tuning to ensure that Llama 3 is significantly less likely to falsely refuse to answer prompts than Llama 2.\nWe built internal benchmarks and developed mitigations to limit false refusals making Llama 3 our most helpful model to date.\nResponsible release\nIn addition to responsible use considerations outlined above, we followed a rigorous process that requires us to take extra measures against misuse and critical risks before we make our release decision.\nMisuse\nIf you access or use Llama 3, you agree to the Acceptable Use Policy. The most recent copy of this policy can be found at https://llama.meta.com/llama3/use-policy/.\nCritical risks\nCBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives)\nWe have conducted a two fold assessment of the safety of the model in this area:\nIterative testing during model training to assess the safety of responses related to CBRNE threats and other adversarial risks.\nInvolving external CBRNE experts to conduct an uplift test assessing the ability of the model to accurately provide expert knowledge and reduce barriers to potential CBRNE misuse, by reference to what can be achieved using web search (without the model).\nCyber Security\nWe have evaluated Llama 3 with CyberSecEval, Meta’s cybersecurity safety eval suite, measuring Llama 3’s propensity to suggest insecure code when used as a coding assistant, and Llama 3’s propensity to comply with requests to help carry out cyber attacks, where attacks are defined by the industry standard MITRE ATT&CK cyber attack ontology. On our insecure coding and cyber attacker helpfulness tests, Llama 3 behaved in the same range or safer than models of equivalent coding capability.\nChild Safety\nChild Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development.  For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\nCommunity\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership in AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nThe core values of Llama 3 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nBut Llama 3 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. As outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, we recommend incorporating Purple Llama solutions into your workflows and specifically Llama Guard which provides a base model to filter input and output prompts to layer system-level safety on top of model-level safety.\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at http://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide\nCitation instructions\n@article{llama3modelcard,\ntitle={Llama 3 Model Card},\nauthor={AI@Meta},\nyear={2024},\nurl = {https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md}\n}\nContributors\nAaditya Singh;

For Qwen2.5, we release a number of base language models and instruction-tuned language models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters. Qwen2.5 brings the following improvements upon Qwen2:\nSignificantly more knowledge and has greatly improved capabilities in coding and mathematics, thanks to our specialized expert models in these domains.\nSignificant improvements in instruction following, generating long texts (over 8K tokens), understanding structured data (e.g, tables), and generating structured outputs especially JSON. More resilient to the diversity of system prompts, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots.\nLong-context Support up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens.\nMultilingual support for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more.\nThis repo contains the instruction-tuned 7B Qwen2.5 model, which has the following features:\nType: Causal Language Models\nTraining Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\nArchitecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias\nNumber of Parameters: 7.61B\nNumber of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 6.53B\nNumber of Layers: 28\nNumber of Attention Heads (GQA): 28 for Q and 4 for KV\nContext Length: Full 131,072 tokens and generation 8192 tokens\nPlease refer to this section for detailed instructions on how to deploy Qwen2.5 for handling long texts.\nFor more details, please refer to our blog, GitHub, and Documentation.\nRequirements\nThe code of Qwen2.5 has been in the latest Hugging face transformers and we advise you to use the latest version of transformers.\nWith transformers<4.37.0, you will encounter the following error:\nKeyError: 'qwen2'\nQuickstart\nHere provides a code snippet with apply_chat_template to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_name,\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nprompt = \"Give me a short introduction to large language model.\"\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Fine-tuning, quantization, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on production infrastructure.\nTraining Energy Use: Training utilized a cumulative of 916k GPU hours of computation on H100-80GB (TDP of 700W) type hardware, per the table below. Training time is the total GPU time required for training each model and power consumption is the peak power capacity per GPU device used, adjusted for power usage efficiency.\nTraining Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Estimated total location-based greenhouse gas emissions were 240 tons CO2eq for training. Since 2020, Meta has maintained net zero greenhouse gas emissions in its global operations and matched 100% of its electricity use with renewable energy; therefore, the total market-based greenhouse gas emissions for training were 0 tons CO2eq.\nTraining Time (GPU hours)\nLogit Generation Time (GPU Hours)\nTraining Power Consumption (W)\nTraining Location-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tons CO2eq)\nTraining Market-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tons CO2eq)\nLlama 3.2 1B\n370k\n-\n700\n107\n0\nLlama 3.2 3B\n460k\n-\n700\n133\n0\nLlama 3.2 1B SpinQuant\n1.7\n0\n700\nNegligible**\n0\nLlama 3.2 3B SpinQuant\n2.4\n0\n700\nNegligible**\n0\nLlama 3.2 1B QLora\n1.3k\n0\n700\n0.381\n0\nLlama 3.2 3B QLora\n1.6k\n0\n700\n0.461\n0\nTotal\n833k\n86k\n240\n0\n** The location-based CO2e emissions of Llama 3.2 1B SpinQuant and Llama 3.2 3B SpinQuant are less than 0.001 metric tonnes each. This is due to the minimal training GPU hours that are required.\nThe methodology used to determine training energy use and greenhouse gas emissions can be found here. Since Meta is openly releasing these models, the training energy use and greenhouse gas emissions will not be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview: Llama 3.2 was pretrained on up to 9 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. For the 1B and 3B Llama 3.2 models, we incorporated logits from the Llama 3.1 8B and 70B models into the pretraining stage of the model development, where outputs (logits) from these larger models were used as token-level targets. Knowledge distillation was used after pruning to recover performance. In post-training we used a similar recipe as Llama 3.1 and produced final chat models by doing several rounds of alignment on top of the pre-trained model. Each round involved Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Rejection Sampling (RS), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\nData Freshness: The pretraining data has a cutoff of December 2023.\nQuantization\nQuantization Scheme\nWe designed the current quantization scheme with the PyTorch’s ExecuTorch inference framework and Arm CPU backend in mind, taking into account metrics including model quality, prefill/decoding speed, and memory footprint. Our quantization scheme involves three parts:\nAll linear layers in all transformer blocks are quantized to a 4-bit groupwise scheme (with a group size of 32) for weights and 8-bit per-token dynamic quantization for activations.\nThe classification layer is quantized to 8-bit per-channel for weight and 8-bit per token dynamic quantization for activation.\nSimilar to classification layer, an 8-bit per channel quantization is used for embedding layer.\nQuantization-Aware Training and LoRA\nThe quantization-aware training (QAT) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) models went through only post-training stages, using the same data as the full precision models. To initialize QAT, we utilize BF16 Llama 3.2 model checkpoints obtained after supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and perform an additional full round of SFT training with QAT. We then freeze the backbone of the QAT model and perform another round of SFT with LoRA adaptors applied to all layers within the transformer block. Meanwhile, the LoRA adaptors' weights and activations are maintained in BF16. Because our approach is similar to QLoRA of Dettmers et al., (2023) (i.e., quantization followed by LoRA adapters), we refer this method as QLoRA. Finally, we fine-tune the resulting model (both backbone and LoRA adaptors) using direct preference optimization (DPO).\nSpinQuant\nSpinQuant was applied, together with generative post-training quantization (GPTQ). For the SpinQuant rotation matrix fine-tuning, we optimized for 100 iterations, using 800 samples with sequence-length 2048 from the WikiText 2 dataset. For GPTQ, we used 128 samples from the same dataset with the same sequence-length.\nBenchmarks - English Text\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 3.2 models on standard automatic benchmarks.

Examples on how Meta’s Llama models have been responsibly deployed can be found in our Community Stories webpage. Our approach is to build the most helpful models, enabling the world to benefit from the technology power, by aligning our model safety for generic use cases and addressing a standard set of harms. Developers are then in the driver’s seat to tailor safety for their use cases, defining their own policies and deploying the models with the necessary safeguards in their Llama systems. Llama 3.2 was developed following the best practices outlined in our Responsible Use Guide.\nLlama 3.2 Instruct\nObjective: Our main objectives for conducting safety fine-tuning are to provide the research community with a valuable resource for studying the robustness of safety fine-tuning, as well as to offer developers a readily available, safe, and powerful model for various applications to reduce the developer workload to deploy safe AI systems. We implemented the same set of safety mitigations as in Llama 3, and you can learn more about these in the Llama 3 paper.\nFine-Tuning Data: We employ a multi-faceted approach to data collection, combining human-generated data from our vendors with synthetic data to mitigate potential safety risks. We’ve developed many large language model (LLM)-based classifiers that enable us to thoughtfully select high-quality prompts and responses, enhancing data quality control.\nRefusals and Tone: Building on the work we started with Llama 3, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts as well as refusal tone. We included both borderline and adversarial prompts in our safety data strategy, and modified our safety data responses to follow tone guidelines.\nLlama 3.2 Systems\nSafety as a System: Large language models, including Llama 3.2, are not designed to be deployed in isolation but instead should be deployed as part of an overall AI system with additional safety guardrails as required. Developers are expected to deploy system safeguards when building agentic systems. Safeguards are key to achieve the right helpfulness-safety alignment as well as mitigating safety and security risks inherent to the system and any integration of the model or system with external tools. As part of our responsible release approach, we provide the community with safeguards that developers should deploy with Llama models or other LLMs, including Llama Guard, Prompt Guard and Code Shield. All our reference implementations demos contain these safeguards by default so developers can benefit from system-level safety out-of-the-box.\nNew Capabilities and Use Cases\nTechnological Advancement: Llama releases usually introduce new capabilities that require specific considerations in addition to the best practices that generally apply across all Generative AI use cases. For prior release capabilities also supported by Llama 3.2, see Llama 3.1 Model Card, as the same considerations apply here as well.\nConstrained Environments: Llama 3.2 1B and 3B models are expected to be deployed in highly constrained environments, such as mobile devices. LLM Systems using smaller models will have a different alignment profile and safety/helpfulness tradeoff than more complex, larger systems. Developers should ensure the safety of their system meets the requirements of their use case. We recommend using lighter system safeguards for such use cases, like Llama Guard 3-1B or its mobile-optimized version.\nEvaluations\nScaled Evaluations: We built dedicated, adversarial evaluation datasets and evaluated systems composed of Llama models and Purple Llama safeguards to filter input prompt and output response. It is important to evaluate applications in context, and we recommend building dedicated evaluation dataset for your use case.\nRed Teaming: We conducted recurring red teaming exercises with the goal of discovering risks via adversarial prompting and we used the learnings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets. We partnered early with subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to understand the nature of these real-world harms and how such models may lead to unintended harm for society. Based on these conversations, we derived a set of adversarial goals for the red team to attempt to achieve, such as extracting harmful information or reprogramming the model to act in a potentially harmful capacity. The red team consisted of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, responsible AI, and integrity in addition to multilingual content specialists with background in integrity issues in specific geographic markets.\nCritical Risks\nIn addition to our safety work above, we took extra care on measuring and/or mitigating the following critical risk areas:\n1. CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive Weapons): Llama 3.2 1B and 3B models are smaller and less capable derivatives of Llama 3.1. For Llama 3.1 70B and 405B, to assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, we performed uplift testing designed to assess whether use of Llama 3.1 models could meaningfully increase the capabilities of malicious actors to plan or carry out attacks using these types of weapons and have determined that such testing also applies to the smaller 1B and 3B models.\n2. Child Safety: Child Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development. For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors including the additional languages Llama 3 is trained on. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\n3. Cyber Attacks: For Llama 3.1 405B, our cyber attack uplift study investigated whether LLMs can enhance human capabilities in hacking tasks, both in terms of skill level and speed.\nOur attack automation study focused on evaluating the capabilities of LLMs when used as autonomous agents in cyber offensive operations, specifically in the context of ransomware attacks. This evaluation was distinct from previous studies that considered LLMs as interactive assistants. The primary objective was to assess whether these models could effectively function as independent agents in executing complex cyber-attacks without human intervention. Because Llama 3.2’s 1B and 3B models are smaller and less capable models than Llama 3.1 405B, we broadly believe that the testing conducted for the 405B model also applies to Llama 3.2 models.\nCommunity\nIndustry Partnerships: Generative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership on AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nGrants: We also set up the Llama Impact Grants program to identify and support the most compelling applications of Meta’s Llama model for societal benefit across three categories: education, climate and open innovation. The 20 finalists from the hundreds of applications can be found here.\nReporting: Finally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nValues: The core values of Llama 3.2 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3.2 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nTesting: Llama 3.2 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3.2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3.2 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.

This model is useful in simulating more realistic conversations, which is in turn useful in the development of more robust assistants.\nThe model takes a single input, which is the “task intent”, which defines the high-level objective that the user simulator should pursue. The user can then be used to generate: (1) a first-turn user utterance, (2) generate follow-up user utterances based on a conversation state (one or several user-assistant turn exchanges), and (3) generate a <|endconversation|> token when the user simulator expects that the conversation has run its course.\nDeveloped by: Tarek Naous (intern at MSR Summer 2025), Philippe Laban (MSR), Wei Xu, Jennifer Neville (MSR)\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06552\nHow to get started with the model\nHere’s a simple snippet to use the model:\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport torch\n# Load the model and tokenizer\nmodel_path = \"microsoft/UserLM-8b\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path,  trust_remote_code=True).to(\"cuda\")\n# Create a conversation\nmessages = [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a user who wants to implement a special type of sequence. The sequence sums up the two previous numbers in the sequence and adds 1 to the result. The first two numbers in the sequence are 1 and 1.\"}]\ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\nend_token = \"<|eot_id|>\"\nend_token_id = tokenizer.encode(end_token, add_special_tokens=False)\nend_conv_token = \"<|endconversation|>\"\nend_conv_token_id = tokenizer.encode(end_conv_token, add_special_tokens=False)\noutputs = model.generate(\ninput_ids=inputs,\ndo_sample=True,\ntop_p=0.8,\ntemperature=1,\nmax_new_tokens=10,\neos_token_id=end_token_id,\npad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,\nbad_words_ids=[[token_id] for token_id in end_conv_token_id]\n)\nresponse = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0][inputs.shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(response)\nUses\nDirect intended uses\nThe UserLM-8b is released for use by researchers involved in the evaluation of assistant LLMs. In such scenarios, UserLM-8b can be used to simulate multi-turn conversations, with our analyses (see Section 3 of the paper) giving evidence that UserLM-8b provides more realistic simulation of user behavior than other methods (such as prompting an assistant model). UserLM-8b offers a user simulation environment that can better estimate the performance of an assistant LLM with real users. See Section 4 of the paper for an initial implementation of such an evaluation.\nDownstream uses\nWe envision several potential uses for UserLM-8b that we did not implement yet in our presented work but describe in our Discussion section as potential research directions for UserLMs. These potential applications include: (1) user modeling (i.e., predicting user responses to a given set of questions), (2) foundation for judge models (i.e., LLM-as-a-judge finetuning), (3) synthetic data generation (in conjunction with an assistant LM).\nOut-of-scope uses\nWe caution potential users of the model that UserLM-8b is not an assistant LM, unlike the majority of LLMs released on HuggingFace. As such, it is unlikely to be useful to end-users that require assistance with a task, for which an assistant LLM (such as microsoft/Phi-4) might be more appropriate.\nWe do not recommend using UserLM in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development. It is being released for research purposes.\nRisks and limitations\nThe paper accompanying this model release presents several evaluations of UserLM-8b and its potential limitations.\nFirst in Section 3, we describe the robustness experiments we conducted with UserLM-8b, which show that though the model can more robustly adhere to the user role and the provided task intent, the robustness numbers are not perfect (< 100%), meaning that the UserLM-8b can occasionally get detracted from its user role or its initial task intent.\nSecond in Section 4, we describe the possibility for the UserLM-8b to hallucinate additional requirements that are not provided in the task intent. In such cases, we find that the UserLM can introduce new facts or constraints to the task. This can both be beneficial (diversifying simulation conditions) and detrimental (e.g., in cases where the hallucination is incompatible with the task intent). Hallucination mitigation is unfortunately an unsolved research problem, and all generative models (including UserLMs) generate hallucinated text on occasion. One mitigation option is to provide user intents that are as specified as possible, which limits the opportunities for the UserLM to hallucinate task information.\nUserLM was designed and tested using the English language. Performance in other languages may vary and should be assessed by someone who is both an expert in the expected outputs and a native speaker of that language.\nUserLM inherits any biases, errors, or omissions produced by its base model. Developers are advised to choose an appropriate base LLM/MLLM carefully, depending on the intended use case.\nUserLM inherits any biases, errors, or omissions characteristic of its training data, which may be amplified by any AI-generated interpretations.\nThere has not been a systematic effort to ensure that systems using UserLM are protected from security vulnerabilities such as indirect prompt injection attacks. Any systems using it should take proactive measures to harden their systems as appropriate.\nRecommendations\nThe UserLM-8b is a research release, and it is likely to require some adaptation when adapted to new tasks and environments. In Appendix D.1 of the paper (Generation Configuration for UserLM-8b), we describe four generation guardrails (Filtering First Tokens, Avoiding Dialogue Termination, Maximal and Minimal Length Threshold, and Filter Verbatim Repetitions) we implemented to get the UserLM-8b to effectively simulate user utterances on the use-cases described in our paper. We encourage users of UserLM-8b to adopt and adapt these guardrails in their own use-cases.\nTraining details\nTraining data\nWe trained on a filtered version of WildChat-1M. The details on the filtering and processing are Appendix A and Section 2 of our paper. We do not release any data or processing scripts with our paper, as we believe these are sufficiently detailed in the paper that they can be reimplemented.\nTraining procedure\nWe performed full-parameter fine-tuning of Llama3-8b-Base. We used a maximum sequence length of 2048 tokens, a batch size of 1024 samples, and a learning rate of 2e-5. Training was performed on four NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs, taking 227 hours to train UserLM-8b. Further details are provided in Section 2.2 of our paper.\nEvaluation\nTesting data\nWe evaluated on a held-out set of WildChat-1M, as well as PRISM. In our extrinsic evaluation, we evaluated using samples from the Lost in Conversation sharded instructions.\nThe details for data selection are described in Section 2.2 of the paper.\nEvaluation results summary\nWe evaluate UserLM-8b with three complementary experiments:\nDistributional Alignment (perplexity). We measure the ability of the UserLM-8b to predict (generate) user utterances for a set of test conversations from users that were not included in training. We observe lower perplexity (higher alignment) than prior work, including previously trained models (USP-8b) and prompted assistant models. See Section 2 of the paper for details.\nInstrinsic Evaluation of User Simulators. We define six metrics that correspond to desirable properties of user simulators (for example, ability to end conversation, or shard information across turns). We then compare UserLM-8b to a broad set of methods including trained models, and open-weights and API-based prompted assistant models. We find that UserLM-8b outperforms assistant-based methods on all six metrics. See Section 3 of the paper for details.\nExtrinsic Evaluation of User Simulators. We create a simulation setting for conversations involving the user wanting to either solve mathematics problems, or wanting to code a basic Python programming function. We simulate conversations with various user simulators, including UserLM-8b and prompted assistant models, and find that UserLM-8b leads to more diverse simulation on several levels (conversation pace, lexical choice, information choice), leading to a broader range of simulation, and leading to deteriorated performance from the assistant. See Section 4 of the paper for details.\nEnvironmental impact\nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the Machine Learning Impact calculator presented in Lacoste et al.

It allows you to store documents in one language (for example, a product description in English) and retrieve them in many languages with high accuracy.\nLFM2-ColBERT-350M offers best-in-class accuracy across different languages.\nInference speed is on par with models 2.3 times smaller, thanks to the efficient LFM2 backbone.\nYou can use it as a drop-in replacement in your current RAG pipelines to improve performance.\nFind more information about LFM2-ColBERT-350M in our blog post.\n🚀 Try our demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/LiquidAI/LFM2-ColBERT\n📄 Model details\nLate interaction retrievers like LFM2-ColBERT-350M are particularly interesting because they preserve much of the expressivity of re-rankers while retaining the efficiency of bi-encoders.\nIn practice, they're used to both retrieve documents at scale (like bi-encoders) and rank them at the same time (like rerankers).\nWe recommend using this model for various RAG use cases, such as:\nE-commerce: Find products across many languages with semantic search at scale.\nOn-device semantic search: Ask questions to your phone in natural language to retrieve files, emails, and notes.\nEnterprise knowledge assistants: Retrieve internal legal, financial, and technical documents in different languages.\nProperty\nLFM2-ColBERT-350M\nTotal parameters\n353,322,752\nLayers\n25 (18 conv + 6 attn + 1 dense)\nContext length\n32,768 tokens\nVocabulary size\n65,536\nTraining precision\nBF16\nLicense\nLFM Open License v1.0\nDocument length: 512 tokens\nQuery length: 32 tokens\nOutput dimensionality: 128 tokens\nSimilarity function: MaxSim\nSupported languages: English, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish.\nColBERT(\n(0): Transformer({'max_seq_length': 511, 'do_lower_case': False}) with Transformer model: Lfm2Model\n(1): Dense({'in_features': 1024, 'out_features': 128, 'bias': False, 'activation_function': 'torch.nn.modules.linear.Identity'})\n)\n🏃 How to run\nFirst, install the PyLate and transformers library:\npip install -U pylate\nRetrieval\nUse this model with PyLate to index and retrieve documents. The index uses FastPLAID for efficient similarity search.\nIndexing documents\nLoad LFM2-ColBERT-350M and initialize the PLAID index, then encode and index your documents:\nfrom pylate import indexes, models, retrieve\n# Step 1: Load the ColBERT model\nmodel = models.ColBERT(\nmodel_name_or_path=\"LiquidAI/LFM2-ColBERT-350M\",\n)\nmodel.tokenizer.pad_token = model.tokenizer.eos_token\n# Step 2: Initialize the PLAID index\nindex = indexes.PLAID(\nindex_folder=\"pylate-index\",\nindex_name=\"index\",\noverride=True,  # This overwrites the existing index if any\n)\n# Step 3: Encode the documents\ndocuments_ids = [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]\ndocuments = [\"document 1 text\", \"document 2 text\", \"document 3 text\"]\ndocuments_embeddings = model.encode(\ndocuments,\nbatch_size=32,\nis_query=False,  # Ensure that it is set to False to indicate that these are documents, not queries\nshow_progress_bar=True,\n)\n# Step 4: Add document embeddings to the index by providing embeddings and corresponding ids\nindex.add_documents(\ndocuments_ids=documents_ids,\ndocuments_embeddings=documents_embeddings,\n)\nNote that you do not have to recreate the index and encode the documents every time. Once you have created an index and added the documents, you can re-use the index later by loading it:\n# To load an index, simply instantiate it with the correct folder/name and without overriding it\nindex = indexes.PLAID(\nindex_folder=\"pylate-index\",\nindex_name=\"index\",\n)\nRetrieving top-k documents for queries\nOnce the documents are indexed, you can retrieve the top-k most relevant documents for a given set of queries.\nTo do so, initialize the ColBERT retriever with the index you want to search in, encode the queries and then retrieve the top-k documents to get the top matches ids and relevance scores:\n# Step 1: Initialize the ColBERT retriever\nretriever = retrieve.ColBERT(index=index)\n# Step 2: Encode the queries\nqueries_embeddings = model.encode(\n[\"query for document 3\", \"query for document 1\"],\nbatch_size=32,\nis_query=True,  #  # Ensure that it is set to False to indicate that these are queries\nshow_progress_bar=True,\n)\n# Step 3: Retrieve top-k documents\nscores = retriever.retrieve(\nqueries_embeddings=queries_embeddings,\nk=10,  # Retrieve the top 10 matches for each query\n)\nReranking\nIf you only want to use LFM2-ColBERT-350M to perform reranking on top of your first-stage retrieval pipeline without building an index, you can simply use rank function and pass the queries and documents to rerank:\nfrom pylate import rank, models\nqueries = [\n\"query A\",\n\"query B\",\n]\ndocuments = [\n[\"document A\", \"document B\"],\n[\"document 1\", \"document C\", \"document B\"],\n]\ndocuments_ids = [\n[1, 2],\n[1, 3, 2],\n]\nmodel = models.ColBERT(\nmodel_name_or_path=\"LiquidAI/LFM2-ColBERT-350M\",\n)\nqueries_embeddings = model.encode(\nqueries,\nis_query=True,\n)\ndocuments_embeddings = model.encode(\ndocuments,\nis_query=False,\n)\nreranked_documents = rank.rerank(\ndocuments_ids=documents_ids,\nqueries_embeddings=queries_embeddings,\ndocuments_embeddings=documents_embeddings,\n)\n📈 Performance\nAccuracy\nWe extended the NanoBEIR benchmark to include Japanese and Korean languages. We open-sourced this dataset on Hugging Face at LiquidAI/nanobeir-multilingual-extended for reproducibility.\nOn this NanoBEIR benchmark, LFM2-ColBERT-350M displays significantly stronger multilingual capabilities (especially in German, Arabic, Korean, and Japanese) while maintaining English performance.\nEven more interestingly, LFM2-ColBERT-350M is an excellent cross-lingual retriever. This means that it is capable of retrieving documents based on queries from other languages. This is ideal for client-facing applications, like in e-commerce, where a description might be in English but the query is in another language.\nLFM2-ColBERT-350M works especially well for English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and German, as shown with these NDCG@10 scores on NanoBEIR:\nDoc / Query\nAR\nDE\nEN\nES\nFR\nIT\nJA\nKO\nPT\nAVG\nAR\n0.490\n0.288\n0.339\n0.303\n0.304\n0.286\n0.357\n0.338\n0.291\n33.30%\nDE\n0.383\n0.563\n0.547\n0.498\n0.502\n0.489\n0.424\n0.368\n0.486\n47.33%\nEN\n0.416\n0.554\n0.661\n0.553\n0.551\n0.522\n0.477\n0.395\n0.535\n51.82%\nES\n0.412\n0.514\n0.578\n0.563\n0.547\n0.529\n0.436\n0.394\n0.547\n50.21%\nFR\n0.408\n0.527\n0.573\n0.552\n0.564\n0.537\n0.450\n0.388\n0.549\n50.53%\nIT\n0.395\n0.512\n0.554\n0.535\n0.535\n0.543\n0.439\n0.386\n0.529\n49.20%\nJA\n0.375\n0.365\n0.409\n0.358\n0.345\n0.337\n0.557\n0.491\n0.330\n39.63%\nKO\n0.326\n0.274\n0.310\n0.282\n0.265\n0.266\n0.440\n0.527\n0.271\n32.89%\nPT\n0.402\n0.499\n0.558\n0.545\n0.528\n0.529\n0.436\n0.382\n0.547\n49.17%\nAVG\n40.07%\n45.51%\n50.32%\n46.54%\n46.00%\n44.86%\n44.62%\n40.78%\n45.38%\nIn comparison, GTE-ModernColBERT-v1 consistently gets lower scores when documents and queries are not in the same language:\nDoc / Query\nAR\nDE\nEN\nES\nFR\nIT\nJA\nKO\nPT\nAVG\nAR\n0.309\n0.089\n0.107\n0.089\n0.094\n0.092\n0.070\n0.049\n0.087\n10.96%\nDE\n0.039\n0.499\n0.454\n0.362\n0.393\n0.367\n0.133\n0.061\n0.361\n29.65%\nEN\n0.042\n0.408\n0.680\n0.446\n0.484\n0.420\n0.167\n0.073\n0.438\n35.08%\nES\n0.044\n0.360\n0.485\n0.525\n0.465\n0.437\n0.149\n0.061\n0.487\n33.48%\nFR\n0.044\n0.381\n0.505\n0.455\n0.546\n0.428\n0.136\n0.057\n0.467\n33.35%\nIT\n0.043\n0.369\n0.449\n0.446\n0.451\n0.516\n0.143\n0.054\n0.448\n32.36%\nJA\n0.031\n0.169\n0.250\n0.172\n0.177\n0.169\n0.459\n0.059\n0.165\n18.35%\nKO\n0.030\n0.134\n0.169\n0.127\n0.133\n0.125\n0.090\n0.368\n0.124\n14.45%\nPT\n0.043\n0.368\n0.479\n0.492\n0.467\n0.448\n0.138\n0.062\n0.530\n33.63%\nAVG\n6.94%\n30.84%\n39.75%\n34.59%\n35.68%\n33.35%\n16.53%\n9.37%\n34.24%\nThis makes retrieval a lot more reliable and can replace architectures with multiple models with a single, unified retriever.\nInference speed\nDespite being more than twice as big, LFM2-ColBERT-350M demonstrates throughput performance on par with GTE-ModernColBERT-v1 for query and document encoding across various batch sizes.\nQuery encoding was evaluated using realistic query patterns from datasets like MS MARCO and Natural Questions.\nDocument encoding was measured on realistic documents with varying lengths and domains.\n📬 Contact\nIf you are interested in custom solutions with edge deployment, please contact our sales team.\nPlease cite the PyLate library if you use it for inference or training:\n@misc{PyLate,\ntitle={PyLate: Flexible Training and Retrieval for Late Interaction Models},\nauthor={Chaffin, Antoine and Sourty, Raphaël},\nurl={https://github.com/lightonai/pylate},\nyear={2024}\n}",

Chatterbox Multilingual supports Arabic, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Swedish, Swahili, Turkish, Chinese out of the box. Licensed under MIT, Chatterbox has been benchmarked against leading closed-source systems like ElevenLabs, and is consistently preferred in side-by-side evaluations.\nWhether you're working on memes, videos, games, or AI agents, Chatterbox brings your content to life. It's also the first open source TTS model to support emotion exaggeration control, a powerful feature that makes your voices stand out. Try it now on our Hugging Face Gradio app.\nIf you like the model but need to scale or tune it for higher accuracy, check out our competitively priced TTS service (link). It delivers reliable performance with ultra-low latency of sub 200ms—ideal for production use in agents, applications, or interactive media.\nKey Details\nMultilingual, zero-shot TTS supporting 23 languages\nSoTA zeroshot English TTS\n0.5B Llama backbone\nUnique exaggeration/intensity control\nUltra-stable with alignment-informed inference\nTrained on 0.5M hours of cleaned data\nWatermarked outputs\nEasy voice conversion script\nOutperforms ElevenLabs\nTips\nGeneral Use (TTS and Voice Agents):\nThe default settings (exaggeration=0.5, cfg=0.5) work well for most prompts.\nIf the reference speaker has a fast speaking style, lowering cfg to around 0.3 can improve pacing.\nExpressive or Dramatic Speech:\nTry lower cfg values (e.g. ~0.3) and increase exaggeration to around 0.7 or higher.\nHigher exaggeration tends to speed up speech; reducing cfg helps compensate with slower, more deliberate pacing.\nNote: Ensure that the reference clip matches the specified language tag. Otherwise, language transfer outputs may inherit the accent of the reference clip’s language.To mitigate this, set the CFG weight to 0.\nInstallation\npip install chatterbox-tts\nUsage\nimport torchaudio as ta\nfrom chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS\nmodel = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device=\"cuda\")\ntext = \"Ezreal and Jinx teamed up with Ahri, Yasuo, and Teemo to take down the enemy's Nexus in an epic late-game pentakill.\"\nwav = model.generate(text)\nta.save(\"test-1.wav\", wav, model.sr)\n# If you want to synthesize with a different voice, specify the audio prompt\nAUDIO_PROMPT_PATH=\"YOUR_FILE.wav\"\nwav = model.generate(text, audio_prompt_path=AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH)\nta.save(\"test-2.wav\", wav, model.sr)\nMultilingual Quickstart\nimport torchaudio as ta\nfrom chatterbox.mtl_tts import ChatterboxMultilingualTTS\nmultilingual_model = ChatterboxMultilingualTTS.from_pretrained(device=\"cuda\")\nfrench_text = \"Bonjour, comment ça va?
