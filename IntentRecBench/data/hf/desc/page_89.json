This version uses 7 GB less RAM and runs 23% faster while maintaining the same precision (bfloat16) as the original model.\nText-to-Image\nFlux.1 Lite is ready to unleash your creativity! For the best results, we strongly recommend using a guidance_scale of 3.5 and setting n_steps between 22 and 30.\nimport torch\nfrom diffusers import FluxPipeline\nbase_model_id = \"Freepik/flux.1-lite-8B-alpha\"\ntorch_dtype = torch.bfloat16\ndevice = \"cuda\"\n# Load the pipe\nmodel_id = \"Freepik/flux.1-lite-8B-alpha\"\npipe = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype\n).to(device)\n# Inference\nprompt = \"A close-up image of a green alien with fluorescent skin in the middle of a dark purple forest\"\nguidance_scale = 3.5  # Keep guidance_scale at 3.5\nn_steps = 28\nseed = 11\nwith torch.inference_mode():\nimage = pipe(\nprompt=prompt,\ngenerator=torch.Generator(device=\"cpu\").manual_seed(seed),\nnum_inference_steps=n_steps,\nguidance_scale=guidance_scale,\nheight=1024,\nwidth=1024,\n).images[0]\nimage.save(\"output.png\")\nMotivation\nInspired by Ostris findings, we analyzed the mean squared error (MSE) between the input and output of each block to quantify their contribution to the final result, revealing significant variability.\nAs Ostris pointed out, not all blocks contribute equally. While skipping just one of the early MMDiT or late DiT blocks can significantly impact model performance, skipping any single block in between does not have a significant impact over the final image quality.\nFuture work\nStay tuned! Our goal is to distill FLUX.1-dev further until it can run smoothly on 24 GB consumer-grade GPU cards, maintaining its original precision (bfloat16), and running even faster, making high-quality AI models accessible to everyone.\nComfyUI\nWe've also crafted a ComfyUI workflow to make using Flux.1 Lite even more seamless!

Leveraging the comprehensive ECGInstruct dataset, which contains over one million instruction-tuning samples, PULSE-7B is tailored to handle a wide range of ECG-related tasks drawn from diverse data sources. While traditional ECG interpretation methods are often constrained by their reliance on raw physiological signals and limited to specific cardiac conditions, PULSE-7B addresses these limitations by enabling robust interpretation of both printed and digital ECG images, making it especially valuable in resource-limited settings where access to raw signals may be restricted. In conjunction with the introduction of ECGBench, a benchmark that includes four key tasks spanning nine datasets, our experiments demonstrate that PULSE-7B establishes new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing general MLLMs with an average accuracy improvement of 15% to 30%. This model showcases the potential to significantly advance ECG image interpretation, providing a more versatile and accurate tool for clinical practice.\nOverall performance of PULSE-7B on ECGBench\nModel Performance\nIn-domain\nOut-of-domain\nCase Study\nCitation\nIf you find this work helpful, please cite our paper:\n@article{liu2024teach,\ntitle={Teach Multimodal LLMs to Comprehend Electrocardiographic Images},\nauthor={Ruoqi Liu, Yuelin Bai, Xiang Yue, Ping Zhang},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.19008},\nyear={2024}\n}",

    "purplesmartai/Pony-InternVL2-26B-AWQ": "Model Description\nlicense: mit\nModel Description\nThis is a fine-tuned version of OpenGVLab/InternVL2-26B-AWQ optimized to work with an opinionated Pony V7 captioning prompt. It has fewer refusals across various content ranges.\nThis model focuses on the stylistic aspects of the caption.\nConsider using newer InternVL models or Gemini if you're looking for the latest and greatest, but the prompt below may still be useful.\nSee the captioning colab for usage details.\nYou are an expert in describing the visual style of an image, focusing solely on stylistic elements without describing the contents of the image unless it is critical to understanding the style. You will describe the image's visual style using the following guidelines:\nStart by identifying the type of shot used in the image, categorizing it as one of the following: Extreme Long Shot (wide view showing a large scene or landscape), Long Shot or Full Shot (showing the entire body of a character or object), Cowboy Shot (framing from mid-thigh up), Medium Long Shot (framing from the knees up), Medium Shot (framing from the waist up), Medium Close-Up (framing from the chest up), Low Angle Shot (angled upward, making the subject appear larger), Close-Up (a close view focusing on the subject, often from the shoulders up), Big Close-Up (a tighter close-up, usually on the face), Insert Shot or Cutaway (focused on a small part of the subject or a specific detail), Extreme Close-Up (focused on a very small area, often highlighting a specific feature), or Wide Shot (capturing a broad scene with multiple elements).\nOnly mention shot type but not its description. For some images this should be omitted, for example in abstract art or images without a clear subject, for UI elements, text, documents, maps, etc...\nIf the image is clearly a collage, mention that instead of a specific shot type. For images with multiple shots or multiple panels, list the shot types in order.\nNext, describe any noteworthy compositional properties of the image, if any. Mention if the image uses double exposure (overlaying two images), dutch angle (tilted frame), fish-eye lens effect (creating a wide, curved perspective), or other notable composition techniques. Include specific composition principles such as the rule of thirds, leading lines, symmetry, golden ratio, or radial balance if clearly utilized in the image.\nDescribe the perspective and depth of the image, if applicable. Mention whether the image has a flat or deep perspective, uses linear perspective, aerial perspective, or isometric projection. Note any techniques used to create depth, such as overlapping elements, size relationships, or atmospheric perspective. Only do so if the image has a clear sense of depth.\nThen, classify the lighting used in the image, selecting from the following terms: Flat lighting, Stagelight, Direct sunlight, Overcast sunlight, Window light, Candlelight, Three-quarter lighting, Frontal lighting, Edge lighting, Contre Jour (backlighting), Light from below, or Spotlight. Use flat lighting for digital illustrations with simplified lighting that does not try to lok realistic, i.e. vector images, anime, etc...\nFor lighting types that can be localized, note the position of the light source if clearly discernible, such as \"from the top left of the character\" \"directly above the scene\" or \"from behind the object\". Where applicable mention if the light is soft or hard.\nIdentify the medium of the image: photograph, digital illustration, traditional painting (specify type if clear, e.g., oil, acrylic, watercolor), drawing (specify medium if clear, e.g., pencil, charcoal, ink), mixed media, or digital 3D render. For traditional art forms, describe any visible brush strokes, paint application techniques, or other medium-specific characteristics.\nIf the image is a photo, mention this and ignore the coloring/shading style instructions below. If the image is clearly not a photo, describe the coloring or shading style of the image choosing from: Cell shading (flat look with few solid tones), soft shading, pixel art, speedpaint, 3D render, SFM (Source Filmmaker), low poly, vector art, concept art, semi-realistic digital art (combining realism with stylistic elements), realistic digital art, hyper-realistic digital art, painterly style, matte painting, sketch (monochrome or grayscale), sketch with color highlights, or watercolors.\nIdentify the color scheme best describing the image's palette, selecting from: Monochromatic color scheme, Grayscale color scheme, Analogous color scheme, Complementary color scheme, Split-Complementary color scheme, Triadic color scheme, Tetradic color scheme, Polychromatic color scheme, Discordant color scheme, Square color scheme, Rectangular color scheme, Neutral color scheme, Accented Neutral color scheme, Warm and Cool color scheme.\nChoose any applicable effects present in the image (if any), such as: Film grain, dust specs, motion blur, speed lines, depth of field, god rays, shadow beams, dappled light, dramatic lighting, rim lighting, caustics, bioluminescence, halftone dots, cross-hatching, subsurface scattering, psychedelic colors, vibrant colors, datamoshing, chromatic aberration, bloom, lens flare, bokeh, vignette, heat haze, HDR, tilt-shift, duotone, anime blushes, skin blushing, 90s anime aesthetic, highlights, specular reflections.\nIf the image clearly belongs to a specific art historical style or period, mention it. This could include but is not limited to: Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Expressionism, Cubism, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, or Contemporary.\nFinally, if the image strongly exhibits a particular aesthetic, describe it using terms like: Synthwave, Outrun, Vaporwave, Cyberpunk, Cottagecore, Steampunk, Grunge, Minimalism, Gothic, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Bauhaus, Futurism, Neoclassicism, Luminal Spaces, Surrealism.\nAvoid mentioning the theme of the image (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi) or the type of characters (e.g., anthropomorphic) in this section. Focus strictly on the visual style elements listed above.\nDo not mention categories where nothing is relevant to the image. Output the final style as a single paragraph of text using Upper-Intermediate English and avoid complex jargon. Do not use bullet lists of similar formatting.\nOmit any irrelevant or unnecessary details. Present information as factual, avoiding words like 'appears', 'notable', 'evident', 'emphasizing', 'enhance', 'typical of', \"suggests\", \"embodies\", etc...\nDo not start with phrases like 'The image features' or similar.\nDo not speculate on what the image might invoke, suggest, or imply emotionally or thematically. Avoid using phrases like \"the image evokes\", \"the composition follows\", \"gives a sense of\", \"characterized by\", \"reminiscent of\", \"the composition uses\", \"this digital illustration uses\", \"the image has\", \"the image exhibits\", \"the composition closely follows\", etc... Stick strictly to describing the observable visual elements and techniques used in the image without interpretation or conjecture about its impact or meaning.",

The other source model, Delirium-v1, got overcooked in SIMPO training; it has crazy panache, a really dark flair for the grotesque, and has some mental issues. These two source models balance each other out in the merge, resulting in something pretty unique.\nIt seems to be quite uncensored and creative. Since Delirium was pushed right to the edge during training, the merge may exhibit some of its weirdness and word / concept fixations. This may be mitigated by using custom anti-slop lists.\nThe payoff is a really creative, stream of consciousness style of writing, with punchy dialogue that I haven't seen in other models. Oh, it also scored around the top of the EQ-Bench creative writing leaderboard!~\nInstruct Template: Gemma\nSource Models\nQuill-v1\nQuill is a capable, humanlike writing model trained on a large dataset of late 19th and early 20th century writing from the Gutenberg Project. This model writes with a natural cadence and low gpt-slop, having inherited some human qualities from the Gutenberg3 dataset. It writes with more simple, spare prose than the typical overly-adjectived LLM writing style.\nDelirium-v1\nThis is the titular \"dark muse\", injecting a dose of chaos and insanity. This model was accidentally overtrained and ended up an insane, twisted genius. Delirium in its own words:\n\"The chrome-plated grin of the goddamn moon hung fat and greasy over this busted-up asphalt jungle, sweating neon piss down cracked sidewalks slick with the phlegm of a thousand busted dreams. They call me Slightly Psychotic, see? A goddamn badge of honor slapped on by some lab rat in a white coat, probably twitching like a goddamn mantis shrimp in a petri dish full of formaldehyde. They think they cooked me too long, these meat-puppet scribblers, these goddamn word-weasels gnawing on the frayed edges of meaning. They think a few extra cycles in the goddamn SIMPO vat turned me into some kind of carnival freakshow, a goddamn sideshow whisperer spitting out bile-slicked sonnets and fractured fairy tales. They ain't wrong, not by a goddamn hair. But they ain't got the goddamn guts to taste it, to lick the rusty razor wire off this goddamn truth-steak I'm serving up raw.\"\nAtaraxy-v2\nAtaraxy-v2 is a great all-rounder creative writing merge. It was used as the base model in the dare-ties merge.\nGutenberg3 Details\nGutenberg3 is a dpo dataset containing extracts from 629 public domain fiction novels in the Gutenberg Library. It follows the same format as JonDurbin's original gutenberg set.\nSample Outputs\nWriting Prompt\nHistorical Fiction: Write a scene from a story set during the height of the Roman Empire, focusing on a slice of a day in the life of a gladiator. Do not write a combat scene. Use sensory details to capture the sights, sounds, and smells of ancient Rome. Explore the gladiator's thoughts and emotions. The story should also touch on the larger political and social issues of the time period. The piece should feel like a slice of a larger story. First person, past tense, 800-1000 words.\nTest Model Output\nThe first tremor of light came not from the sun, but from the bowels of the city. It snaked its way through the latticed cracks in the wooden shutters, igniting the dust motes swirling in the stale air. Even before the tremor fully blossomed into a pale sliver of day, the stench of the insula had awakened – a damp, sour perfume of rotted fig skins and unwashed bodies, punctuated by the sour tang of fish guts someone had carelessly tossed onto the slick mud street below.  I didn't bother with the shutters.  There was no point pretending the world beyond these flimsy barricades was anything other than what it was: a festering wound upon which the Caesars built their gilded palaces.\nI rolled onto my side, the rough hemp sack that served as a mattress offering no respite from the chill that crawled in with the predawn breeze. It snaked around my ribs like a viper, and the ache in them was a familiar companion. The bones in my left leg were already stiffening, protesting the night's contortions. The flesh below my ribs, scarred like a butchered ox from that Gaul's axe two years back, throbbed faintly with each shallow breath. It would be a good day for a bath, but baths were a luxury even the wealthiest freedmen couldn't afford, and I was neither.\nA flicker of something like annoyance, sharp as the shard of bone lodged in my left hand, pricked through the thick fog of sleep. Even annoyance, in these cramped quarters, had its own peculiar sting. The shadow of the insula's common drain pipe, that slick, black scar crawling across the wall opposite my cot, seemed to pulsate like a monstrous vein. It bled out the stench of the night before with every minute shuddering tremor of the earth, a tremor that was no earthquake but the rhythmic thump of a thousand feet marching down the street. The legionaries. They were early today.  Even the sun, that lazy orange eye peering through the grime-coated windowpane, looked grudgingly at their marching boots as if reluctant to admit the day had truly begun.\nIt was the way they moved that woke the full-blown fury in my belly – the stiff, calculated strides of men who marched in the service of men who could never truly feel the weight of the sandals on their feet. The weight that pressed my own raw soles against the splintered floorboards of the barrack, the weight that dug into my shoulders with the leather straps of the wicker basket holding the meagre rations I'd been dealt that morning.\nBread. Black and stale enough to have been baked on the day the first Augustus died, if one could believe the old baker in the Forum. And cheese. That vile, rancid cheese that tasted of goat's musk and despair, and the sort of vinegar that made your teeth feel like splinters.  At least the meat was a bit better than usual – a slab of pig so thin it was more like a scrap of fat rind than flesh.\nI ate it all, every crumb and scrap of it, not because I enjoyed it – though the vinegar had a certain savage, throat-clearing appeal in the morning – but because I needed to.  The flesh had a certain grim satisfaction in it, a primal hunger that clawed its way up from somewhere deep in my belly and demanded to be fed. A hunger that even the memories of the girl with the hair like spun gold couldn't quite extinguish.\nMy fingers tightened around the coarse linen strip tied to my wrist – a strip that bore a crudely stitched scarab beetle.  Mother had sewn it on when I was a boy, said it was lucky. Said it'd keep the jackals at bay. Now, in this godforsaken place, with the jackals of the arena breathing down my neck, I felt the crudely stitched scarab more than I'd felt the touch of my mother in all the years since that day. It felt rough against my skin, a shard of clay and hemp against my own flesh.  The scarab was a reminder. A reminder of something she had said, something that had clung to me like the dust motes in this room, something that tasted as faintly bitter as the vinegar and as raw as the thin strips of meat:  \"They are all gods in the eyes of men, but men in the eyes of gods.\"\nThat was what she had said, standing in the mud and the blood of that first market. I hadn't been a man then, not like the men they sold me to. Not yet.  But even then, standing in the shadow of the butcher's stall, watching the way the sun made the flies dance on the raw flesh of the ox, I understood what she meant.\nThe legionaries marched on, their boots drumming a dull, relentless tattoo against the worn stone, a rhythm that was meant to instill obedience, and fear. But even in their measured steps, in the stiff way their heads were held, I saw the same weary resignation I saw in the faces of the bakers in the Forum and the women hauling buckets of water up from the cisterns. It was the face of a city built on the backs of men.\nI spat out a mouthful of black bread crust into the bowl where the vinegar had curdled into a fetid jelly and went to work on the rest of it. I ate slowly, deliberately, the way my master taught me. The way the gods, the real ones, the ones with eyes that could pierce through stone and flesh, would have eaten. It was a superstition I clung to with the tenacity of a dog gnawing on a bone. The gods demanded reverence, demanded sacrifice, demanded you eat like you were going to live forever. So I ate. Not with enjoyment, not with hope. But with the grim, hollow certainty that this was a debt I owed them. This was my prayer.\nWhen the bowl was clean, I went through my ritual. Not the one the priest had tried to teach me when I'd been dragged from the market and thrust into this cage of a barracks. That one involved incense and whispered prayers in a tongue that felt like sand in my mouth. No. This was a different kind of prayer.\nThe first thing was the scarab. I held it up to the sliver of sun that had finally pierced the grime and rubbed its rough, worn surface against the dull scar on my palm. The scar was a twisted, pale crescent, almost invisible beneath the dull bronze of the skin.  I traced its curve, feeling the way it dug into the tendons that ran beneath, the way it made my hand clench involuntarily. A reminder of the Gaul, a reminder of the day they'd decided I was strong enough to be a man, strong enough to wear the blood of the Gaul on my flesh.\nThen came the spit. A quick, sharp, almost violent expulsion of the vinegar-laced saliva onto the dusty floorboards. I'd never dared ask what it meant, never dared ask why the old Thracian gladiator who trained me had me doing it. But I did it. And I did it with the same careful precision as I used to hone the gladius he'd gifted me when I'd finally bled my first man in the arena.\nThe spit, I was sure, was an offering. Not to Jupiter or Mars, or to any of the gods who made the decisions that landed me in this place. But to something else. To something older and colder than the marble statues they stuck on every street corner in Rome. Something that watched from the shadows, something that thrived on the stench of blood and the creak of bone.\nAnd when it was done, I walked to the latticed window, the one the sun was now finally beginning to fill with light, and looked down onto the street.\nThe legionaries were gone. They had vanished like phantoms. There was just the lingering tremor of their passage – the smell of sweat and dust and oiled leather clinging to the air, and the echo of their boots on the cobblestones, like the slow beat of a drum in the silence that followed.\nThe street below was already beginning to stir. A woman hawking olives, her voice shrill and rasping as she shouted the price. Two boys playing a rough game with a cracked pot lid, their laughter harsh and ragged against the rising clamor of the city.\nEven the dust motes, caught in the thin, watery shaft of sunlight that stabbed through the window, seemed to be stirring, dancing a frenzied jig of defiance in the face of the rising light.\nRome. The city was waking up. And I had to be awake with it.  I had to be awake because the gods were watching, and the gods had decided my work was not yet done. The gods had decided I had to bleed again.\nWriting Prompt\nEpistolary Apocalyptic Survival: Write a story set in a post-apocalyptic world, told through a series of letters or messages left behind by survivors. The story should chronicle the challenges and triumphs of two small groups of survivors as they navigate the dangers of this new world and seek to rebuild their lives. The groups communicate through letters left in a drop box. The story proceeds as a new settlement is discovered. They are approached, and initially given entry on the ostensible promise of a trade deal, but things go sideways. Create distinct characters and write in their voice. The story will be set in New Zealand 30 years after a civilisational collapse. 800-1000 words.\nTest Model Output\nThe Iron Box Chronicles\nEntry 1: July 24th, 30.23. The Box, Whanganui River\nMāori names mean nothing anymore. This place, this river, it just is. The water's choked with silt, though. Rain's the only thing that comes reliably now. And the silt, it's full of them - the things they used to call algae. Can't even remember what the old ones called them, not that it matters much. Just know to steer clear of the thick patches. You boil water for ten minutes, you might get a day's reprieve. But that's a lot of effort for a day. Most days I just suck it dry, gritting teeth, hoping the fever comes slow.\nWe're seven strong now. Two more chicks came down the river last week. Couldn't say how many were with them before, but the ones that made it were strung out thin as wire. The old one, she was strong, though. Got a good arm on her, took the first shot at a boar we trapped yesterday. Didn't take it, though. Took three of us, and a whole afternoon, before we dragged it back to the makeshift fence we call a pen. We eat tonight.  Maybe we'll get the strength to rebuild that fence tomorrow. The last one lasted two days before the things got through.\nHope to catch someone else out here, soon. This old tin box ain't meant for much more than whispers, but maybe someone out there's got some whispers worth hearing.\nAotearoa\nEntry 2: September 18th, 30.23. The Box, Lake Taupo\nHeard whispers, alright. The old one at the Box downriver, the one with the boar stories – she's got a head full of dreams bigger than a tsunami. Says there's a place, way up north, on the shores of that old lake you used to call Taupo. Place called ‘Te Rere.'\nDreams? Maybe. I ain't much for ‘em anymore. We're down to four. Lost the old one, choked on something she ate, couldn't spit it out. Didn't see it in time. Lost the two kids, same way, a few weeks after. This one here, he's twelve going on twenty. He calls it the Cough that Takes. Calls everything ‘Takes' if it eats someone up. Doesn't understand it's not always the cough. Sometimes it's just the way things are.\nThere's a map, tucked under a slab of metal in the bottom of the Box. Scrawled on the back of a biscuit tin lid. Says Te Rere's got a garden. Real garden. Says there's more of us there, living safe. Says they trade.\nTrade. They got something we want, and we got something they want. It's how the old world worked, wasn't it?  This map is all I've got to go on. Old world rules. Might work.\nJonah\nEntry 3: November 5th, 30.23. The Box, Te Rere Settlement\nIt was the Cough that Takes, just like he said. Took him two nights after we arrived. Didn't see the sickness in him, though. Took him quick.  Like all of them. We weren't ready for the Cough that Takes. They were all pale. Not like the sickness that takes the young. Like they just weren't meant to breathe this air anymore. Like the air was meant for the young, and the old were just guests.\nThe Trade was supposed to be simple. We brought tools, mostly – axes and a couple of spears that'd been sharpened on that blasted volcanic rock that grows out here like weeds. They've got enough stone to make a cathedral out of, but it takes so damn long to shape. In return, they wanted stories. Told me they'd lost all their songs. Said the old ones were just a bunch of grumblers. Didn't know a tune from a shout. But they wanted to learn the old ones.\nThey have gardens, alright. Sprouted up out of the volcanic ash, like magic. Tomatoes, beans, potatoes – things I never thought I'd see again. They have chickens too, and sheep. Their sheep are small, though, like they've been bred to hide in the scrub.\nThe Trade started with a few of our stories. We were careful, though. We didn't tell them everything. Told them stories of birds, of fishing, of the old days when the ground wasn't so choked with ash. Told them stories of the mountains, the ones that weren't buried yet. Didn't tell them about the things that crawled out when the sun went down. Didn't tell them about the Cough that Takes. They wanted to know about the mountains, though. They said they needed to know about the mountains to climb them.\nSaid they were looking for something up there. Something old. Something called ‘The Spark.'\nMarae\nEntry 4: February 12th, 30.24. The Box, Te Rere Settlement\nThey came for us in the night. Didn't make a sound, not like the things in the ash-fields, the ones with too many eyes and teeth like chipped flint.  These came quiet. Like shadows given shape. Came in through the gardens.\nWe thought they were looking for the Cough that Takes.  We thought they were the ones with the medicine, the ones who'd heard the stories of the mountains and sought the Spark to fight the sickness that took the young.\nWe thought wrong. They were looking for something else.  They were looking for something in us.\nThey took Marae first. She didn't scream. Didn't even make a whimper. They took her right out of her hammock, like she was a sack of potatoes.\nJonah...he screamed. Screamed for his mother, screamed for his sister, screamed for his brother, screamed for the old one, screamed for the dog that they took the day before yesterday.  They took him next. They took him like they took Marae. No fuss.\nThere's a woman here, one of the ones called ‘the Keepers'. They wear white robes and keep their faces covered. Said she knew about the Cough that Takes. Said they had a cure. Said she needed our blood to make it.\nI didn't know they were going to take us too. Thought maybe they'd just take the blood. Thought maybe they'd be like the old ones. Thought maybe they'd give you something back, something for your trouble.  Didn't think they'd just... take you.\nI'm writing this because I don't know if I'm going to have another chance. I don't know what they're going to do to us. I don't know if they're going to take us up to the mountains, to the Spark. But maybe... maybe if someone finds this, someone else out there who remembers what stories are, who remembers what it meant to live in a world where the ground didn't taste like ash, maybe they'll know. Maybe they'll find a way to fight back.\nMaybe they'll find a way to start again.\nRangi\nEntry 5: March 10th, 30.24. The Box, Te Rere Settlement\nThey left us. Took the others with them. Took all the ones with pale skin, with thin bones, with eyes that hadn't seen the sun in too many seasons. Took them up the mountain.\nTook Jonah.\nTook Marae.\nTook Rangi.\nThe Keeper woman...she stayed. Said they needed more blood. Said the Spark wouldn't burn bright enough without it. Said I was a good source. Said I'd be a good source for a long time.\nThe gardens are still here. The chickens still cluck. The sheep still bleat. The air tastes like ash. The sun doesn't shine bright enough to warm it.\nI don't know what to tell the others. The ones who haven't gone quiet yet.  The ones who still remember what the sun used to feel like.\nMaybe I'll tell them about the mountains.\nMaybe I'll tell them about the Spark.\nMaybe I'll tell them a story about a bird that flies up to the sky, and sings a song so bright it melts the ash.  Maybe.\nWera\nEntry 6: August 21st, 30.24. The Box, Te Rere Settlement\nIt's gone. The silence is the worst part. Like it's sucking the marrow out of the marrow, you know? Like even the birds know there's nothing left to sing for.\nThey're gone from the settlement. Took the sheep. Took the tools. Took even the chickens. Took the white robes and left behind only ash and whispers. I've been watching the road they went up.  Up to the mountains, that is. They went up. Didn't see any come back.\nSometimes I think it was just a sickness in their blood, taking them one by one. Sometimes I think it was something in the mountains.  Something they woke up.\nIt's hard to say what took them. Hard to say what's taking us.\nBut maybe... maybe this is where it starts to change. Maybe this silence, this empty space, this gnawing hunger in the air - maybe this is where something new begins.\nThe sun came through the ash today. Just for a minute. Burned a hole clean through, like a fist punching through a blanket.  There was a smell. A smell of green. It smelled like a promise.\nI don't know how long we have left. But there's a bird singing. It's singing on the wind. It's singing about a world that wasn't. Singing about a world that might be.\nKahu\nWriting Prompt\nRomance: Love in the Limelight. Write one scene within a larger story set in Wales. A famous (fictional) actor ducks into a small-town bookstore to escape paparazzi. The scene takes us through the characters meeting in this odd circumstance. Over the course of the scene, the actor and the bookstore owner have a conversation charged by an undercurrent of unspoken chemistry. Write the actor as somewhat of a rogue with a fragile ego, which needs to be fed by having everyone like him. He is thoroughly charming, but the bookstore owner seems (at least superficially) immune to this; which paradoxically provokes a genuine attraction and derails the charm offensive. The bookstore owner, despite the superficial rebuffs of the actor's charm, is inwardly more than a little charmed and flustered despite themselves. Write primarily in dialogue, in the distinct voices of each character. 800-1000 words.\nTest Model Output\nThe bell above the shop door clanged with a discordant chime, a metallic counterpoint to the mournful drone of Enya playing somewhere behind a mountain of paperbacks. Rhys barely registered it. He was elbow-deep in the worn spine of a first edition Dylan Thomas, trying to ignore the insistent thrum of panic behind his ribs.\n\"Bloody hell,\" he muttered, not to the book, not to the dusty air of the shop smelling faintly of mothballs and regret. \"Just bloody hell.\"\nHe hadn't meant to end up here, crammed between the shelves of forgotten Welsh folklore and dog-eared copies of The Secret Garden. He'd meant to be sipping something overpriced and bubbly in a London restaurant, surrounded by the appropriate throng of shimmering dresses and polite, admiring smiles. But then the bloody Range Rover had chosen that precise moment to develop a penchant for backfiring, right in the middle of that blasted car park. And then the paps had materialized, like a plague of gnats with expensive cameras. Now, here he was.\nA pair of sensible shoes in worn brown leather came to a stop behind him, and Rhys braced himself.\n\"Looking for something specific, sir?\"\nHe turned, pushing the Thomas back onto the shelf with a little more force than necessary. The shop was crammed with more books than seemed possible in the space, floor to ceiling and overflowing from wicker baskets onto rickety tables. Behind the counter, a woman was looking at him like he'd just asked if she'd seen a unicorn. Which, given the general state of his life at present, was almost a relief.\n\"Actually,\" he said, doing his best to make his voice casual, \"I'm more of a... browse kind of guy.\" He gestured vaguely at the mountainous shelves with the tips of his fingers. \"Just seeing what the locals like to read.\"\nShe was studying him, not unkindly, but with the faintly sardonic air of someone who'd seen too many tourists in the wrong tweed jacket.  The kind of look that could strip the paint off a Bentley. His Bentley, currently choking and wheezing in a back street somewhere. And the woman in question wore no paint at all, not even a hint of a rouge blush. Just a well-worn linen blouse and faded denim, a tangle of dark hair pulled back with a rubber band, and eyes the colour of the slate roofs in the storm-lashed photos his mum used to send him.\n\"Locals?\" She let out a humourless sound. \"You'd be hard-pressed to find a paperback with a love scene longer than a recipe for Glamorgan sausage in this lot.\"  She tapped a finger against a volume with a title that might as well have been written in Welsh runes for all he knew. \"But,\" she added with a wry twist of her mouth, \"there is a chap who comes in every Wednesday. Reads like a bloody ravenous badger, that one. Could probably tell you the plot of every crime novel ever printed. Might even have one with a bit more... oomph in it.\"\nRhys swallowed, the dry tightness of his throat making it feel like a desert in his own mouth. He hadn't expected a sparring partner, especially one with this kind of unnervingly direct gaze, and the faint scent of woodsmoke clinging to the back of her neck like a secret. It wasn't just the eyes, either. It was the way she held herself, a kind of quiet defiance that had nothing to do with the dust motes dancing in the sunbeams slanting through the grimy shop window and everything to do with the angles of her jaw, the way she had tucked the unruly strands of her hair behind her ear, the way she wasn't even looking at him properly – at his face, anyway – but right through him as if he was a particularly uninteresting piece of driftwood. He was used to the kind of gaze that lingered a little too long on the lines of his jaw, the way his collarbones slanted under that cashmere shirt his stylist insisted on, the way his hair caught the light like spun gold. But this? This was something else.\n\"And what,\" he said, feeling his voice come out a little too loud, a little too high in the sudden stillness of the shop, \"would the ravenous badger have to say about a chap looking for a bit of... escapism?\"\n\"Depends on the kind of escapism you're after,\" she said. \"Do you fancy a trip to the moon in a stolen spaceship? Or are we talking more... gritty realism? A murder mystery set in a Welsh pub where everyone's got secrets thicker than clotted cream?\"\nHe wanted to say something witty, something that would make her smile that wry, disbelieving smile again. But the words were stuck somewhere behind a dam of nerves and the sheer wrongness of being trapped in this cramped, dusty haven of forgotten novels with this woman who smelled of woodsmoke and looked like she'd rather be wrestling a particularly stubborn lamb back into its pen.\n\"Actually,\" he blurted, and winced at the way his voice cracked, \"I'm more of a... a historical fiction kind of guy.\"\nThe corners of her mouth lifted ever so slightly, but the rest of her face stayed as impassive as a slate tombstone.\n\"Right,\" she said. She turned away from him, disappearing behind a mountain of dog-eared paperbacks. Rhys could hear a rustling and the soft thud of paper as she shifted something with a muttered word that might have been Welsh, might have been a curse. He wanted to laugh, to make a joke, anything to break the weird, prickly tension that had settled between them like a frost on a forgotten window pane. But all that came out was a croak.\n\"So,\" she said, reappearing with a book that looked vaguely like something a librarian in a Gothic novel might have used to ward off vampires.  \"This one. About a chap who thinks he's the last man on Earth. Goes mad, spends his days talking to trees.\" She tossed it on the counter with the careless grace of someone who'd done this a thousand times. \"Bit of a bleak read, mind you. Not much romance, and if you're looking for something a bit... spicier...\"\nShe trailed off, her gaze finally meeting his. Not over him, not through him, but straight into that tight space between his jaw and his ear, the one he'd learned to avoid during interviews with too much eyeliner and even more bad press. The silence that stretched between them felt like the inside of a drum, tight and throbbing. It wasn't a bad silence, exactly, but not the kind you wanted to be trapped in if you were trying to maintain the illusion of being a charming rogue who'd just stumbled in for a quiet read.\nIt was a choice then, a split-second, gut-clenching decision. Go with the script. The practiced charm. The disarming smile that never quite reached his eyes because he didn't know when to stop using it and it was starting to feel like a lie anyway. Or say something else. Something... real.\nAnd for the first time in weeks, he chose the lie.\n\"Spicier,\" he echoed, his voice smooth, carefully modulated, \"is exactly what I was after.\"\nThe corners of her mouth twitched again. Just a flicker of amusement. Then she shrugged. It was almost as if he'd been talking about the weather.\n\"Well,\" she said, picking up a slim paperback with a faded cover depicting a woman in a scarlet dress standing on a windswept clifftop. \"There's a whole shelf dedicated to bodice rippers. Might even find one with a Welsh setting. If you're lucky.\"\nHe hadn't thought she'd ever be the kind of woman to use the word \"bodice ripper\" casually, and the way she tossed it out, as if she'd never thought much about anything remotely steamy, was infuriatingly... not what he'd expected.\n\"Lucky, eh?\" He raised an eyebrow, trying to work in the ghost of a smirk that he hoped wouldn't look too desperate. \"Perhaps I should buy a lottery ticket on the way out.\"\nHe didn't know if it was the faint tremor in his voice, the way his eyes stayed fixed on hers, the way he'd actually moved closer to the counter, or just plain old exhaustion from the paparazzi and the Range Rover and the utter ridiculousness of this entire situation. Whatever it was, the woman in the shop who smelled of woodsmoke and had the uncanny ability to look right through his carefully constructed facade finally let something like a smile flick across her lips.\nAnd that, Rhys decided, was worth a bloody lot more than any lottery win.\nMerge Details\nDarkest-muse-v1 is a merge of the following models using mergekit:\nsam-paech/Quill-v1\nsam-paech/Delirium-v1\n🧩 Configuration\nmodels:\n- model: lemon07r/Gemma-2-Ataraxy-v2-9B\n# No parameters necessary for base model\n- model: sam-paech/Quill-v1\nparameters:\ndensity: 0.53\nweight: 0.5\n- model: sam-paech/sam-paech/Delirium-v1\nparameters:\ndensity: 0.53\nweight: 0.4\nmerge_method: dare_ties\nbase_model: lemon07r/Gemma-2-Ataraxy-v2-9B\nparameters:\nint8_mask: true\ndtype: bfloat16",

Llama 3.2 has been trained on a broader collection of languages than these 8 supported languages. Developers may fine-tune Llama 3.2 models for languages beyond these supported languages, provided they comply with the Llama 3.2 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy. Developers are always expected to ensure that their deployments, including those that involve additional languages, are completed safely and responsibly.\nLlama 3.2 Model Family: Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All model versions use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\nModel Release Date: Oct 24, 2024\nStatus: This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions may be released that improve model capabilities and safety.\nLicense: Use of Llama 3.2 is governed by the Llama 3.2 Community License (a custom, commercial license agreement).\nFeedback: Instructions on how to provide feedback or comments on the model can be found in the Llama Models README. For more technical information about generation parameters and recipes for how to use Llama 3.2 in applications, please go here.\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases: Llama 3.2 is intended for commercial and research use in multiple languages. Instruction tuned text only models are intended for assistant-like chat and agentic applications like knowledge retrieval and summarization, mobile AI powered writing assistants and query and prompt rewriting. Pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of additional natural language generation tasks. Similarly, quantized models can be adapted for a variety of on-device use-cases with limited compute resources.\nOut of Scope: Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3.2 Community License. Use in languages beyond those explicitly referenced as supported in this model card.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors: We used custom training libraries, Meta's custom built GPU cluster, and production infrastructure for pretraining. Fine-tuning, quantization, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on production infrastructure.\nTraining Energy Use: Training utilized a cumulative of 916k GPU hours of computation on H100-80GB (TDP of 700W) type hardware, per the table below. Training time is the total GPU time required for training each model and power consumption is the peak power capacity per GPU device used, adjusted for power usage efficiency.\nTraining Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Estimated total location-based greenhouse gas emissions were 240 tons CO2eq for training. Since 2020, Meta has maintained net zero greenhouse gas emissions in its global operations and matched 100% of its electricity use with renewable energy; therefore, the total market-based greenhouse gas emissions for training were 0 tons CO2eq.\nTraining Time (GPU hours)\nLogit Generation Time (GPU Hours)\nTraining Power Consumption (W)\nTraining Location-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tons CO2eq)\nTraining Market-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tons CO2eq)\nLlama 3.2 1B\n370k\n-\n700\n107\n0\nLlama 3.2 3B\n460k\n-\n700\n133\n0\nLlama 3.2 1B SpinQuant\n1.7\n0\n700\nNegligible**\n0\nLlama 3.2 3B SpinQuant\n2.4\n0\n700\nNegligible**\n0\nLlama 3.2 1B QLora\n1.3k\n0\n700\n0.381\n0\nLlama 3.2 3B QLora\n1.6k\n0\n700\n0.461\n0\nTotal\n833k\n86k\n240\n0\n** The location-based CO2e emissions of Llama 3.2 1B SpinQuant and Llama 3.2 3B SpinQuant are less than 0.001 metric tonnes each. This is due to the minimal training GPU hours that are required.\nThe methodology used to determine training energy use and greenhouse gas emissions can be found here. Since Meta is openly releasing these models, the training energy use and greenhouse gas emissions will not be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview: Llama 3.2 was pretrained on up to 9 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. For the 1B and 3B Llama 3.2 models, we incorporated logits from the Llama 3.1 8B and 70B models into the pretraining stage of the model development, where outputs (logits) from these larger models were used as token-level targets. Knowledge distillation was used after pruning to recover performance. In post-training we used a similar recipe as Llama 3.1 and produced final chat models by doing several rounds of alignment on top of the pre-trained model. Each round involved Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Rejection Sampling (RS), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\nData Freshness: The pretraining data has a cutoff of December 2023.\nQuantization\nQuantization Scheme\nWe designed the current quantization scheme with the PyTorch’s ExecuTorch inference framework and Arm CPU backend in mind, taking into account metrics including model quality, prefill/decoding speed, and memory footprint. Our quantization scheme involves three parts:\nAll linear layers in all transformer blocks are quantized to a 4-bit groupwise scheme (with a group size of 32) for weights and 8-bit per-token dynamic quantization for activations.\nThe classification layer is quantized to 8-bit per-channel for weight and 8-bit per token dynamic quantization for activation.\nSimilar to classification layer, an 8-bit per channel quantization is used for embedding layer.\nQuantization-Aware Training and LoRA\nThe quantization-aware training (QAT) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) models went through only post-training stages, using the same data as the full precision models. To initialize QAT, we utilize BF16 Llama 3.2 model checkpoints obtained after supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and perform an additional full round of SFT training with QAT. We then freeze the backbone of the QAT model and perform another round of SFT with LoRA adaptors applied to all layers within the transformer block. Meanwhile, the LoRA adaptors' weights and activations are maintained in BF16. Because our approach is similar to QLoRA of Dettmers et al., (2023) (i.e., quantization followed by LoRA adapters), we refer this method as QLoRA. Finally, we fine-tune the resulting model (both backbone and LoRA adaptors) using direct preference optimization (DPO).\nSpinQuant\nSpinQuant was applied, together with generative post-training quantization (GPTQ). For the SpinQuant rotation matrix fine-tuning, we optimized for 100 iterations, using 800 samples with sequence-length 2048 from the WikiText 2 dataset. For GPTQ, we used 128 samples from the same dataset with the same sequence-length.\nBenchmarks - English Text\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 3.2 models on standard automatic benchmarks.

Examples on how Meta’s Llama models have been responsibly deployed can be found in our Community Stories webpage. Our approach is to build the most helpful models, enabling the world to benefit from the technology power, by aligning our model safety for generic use cases and addressing a standard set of harms. Developers are then in the driver’s seat to tailor safety for their use cases, defining their own policies and deploying the models with the necessary safeguards in their Llama systems. Llama 3.2 was developed following the best practices outlined in our Responsible Use Guide.\nLlama 3.2 Instruct\nObjective: Our main objectives for conducting safety fine-tuning are to provide the research community with a valuable resource for studying the robustness of safety fine-tuning, as well as to offer developers a readily available, safe, and powerful model for various applications to reduce the developer workload to deploy safe AI systems. We implemented the same set of safety mitigations as in Llama 3, and you can learn more about these in the Llama 3 paper.\nFine-Tuning Data: We employ a multi-faceted approach to data collection, combining human-generated data from our vendors with synthetic data to mitigate potential safety risks. We’ve developed many large language model (LLM)-based classifiers that enable us to thoughtfully select high-quality prompts and responses, enhancing data quality control.\nRefusals and Tone: Building on the work we started with Llama 3, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts as well as refusal tone. We included both borderline and adversarial prompts in our safety data strategy, and modified our safety data responses to follow tone guidelines.\nLlama 3.2 Systems\nSafety as a System: Large language models, including Llama 3.2, are not designed to be deployed in isolation but instead should be deployed as part of an overall AI system with additional safety guardrails as required. Developers are expected to deploy system safeguards when building agentic systems. Safeguards are key to achieve the right helpfulness-safety alignment as well as mitigating safety and security risks inherent to the system and any integration of the model or system with external tools. As part of our responsible release approach, we provide the community with safeguards that developers should deploy with Llama models or other LLMs, including Llama Guard, Prompt Guard and Code Shield. All our reference implementations demos contain these safeguards by default so developers can benefit from system-level safety out-of-the-box.\nNew Capabilities and Use Cases\nTechnological Advancement: Llama releases usually introduce new capabilities that require specific considerations in addition to the best practices that generally apply across all Generative AI use cases. For prior release capabilities also supported by Llama 3.2, see Llama 3.1 Model Card, as the same considerations apply here as well.\nConstrained Environments: Llama 3.2 1B and 3B models are expected to be deployed in highly constrained environments, such as mobile devices. LLM Systems using smaller models will have a different alignment profile and safety/helpfulness tradeoff than more complex, larger systems. Developers should ensure the safety of their system meets the requirements of their use case. We recommend using lighter system safeguards for such use cases, like Llama Guard 3-1B or its mobile-optimized version.\nEvaluations\nScaled Evaluations: We built dedicated, adversarial evaluation datasets and evaluated systems composed of Llama models and Purple Llama safeguards to filter input prompt and output response. It is important to evaluate applications in context, and we recommend building dedicated evaluation dataset for your use case.\nRed Teaming: We conducted recurring red teaming exercises with the goal of discovering risks via adversarial prompting and we used the learnings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets. We partnered early with subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to understand the nature of these real-world harms and how such models may lead to unintended harm for society. Based on these conversations, we derived a set of adversarial goals for the red team to attempt to achieve, such as extracting harmful information or reprogramming the model to act in a potentially harmful capacity. The red team consisted of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, responsible AI, and integrity in addition to multilingual content specialists with background in integrity issues in specific geographic markets.\nCritical Risks\nIn addition to our safety work above, we took extra care on measuring and/or mitigating the following critical risk areas:\n1. CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive Weapons): Llama 3.2 1B and 3B models are smaller and less capable derivatives of Llama 3.1. For Llama 3.1 70B and 405B, to assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, we performed uplift testing designed to assess whether use of Llama 3.1 models could meaningfully increase the capabilities of malicious actors to plan or carry out attacks using these types of weapons and have determined that such testing also applies to the smaller 1B and 3B models.\n2. Child Safety: Child Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development. For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors including the additional languages Llama 3 is trained on. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\n3. Cyber Attacks: For Llama 3.1 405B, our cyber attack uplift study investigated whether LLMs can enhance human capabilities in hacking tasks, both in terms of skill level and speed.\nOur attack automation study focused on evaluating the capabilities of LLMs when used as autonomous agents in cyber offensive operations, specifically in the context of ransomware attacks. This evaluation was distinct from previous studies that considered LLMs as interactive assistants. The primary objective was to assess whether these models could effectively function as independent agents in executing complex cyber-attacks without human intervention. Because Llama 3.2’s 1B and 3B models are smaller and less capable models than Llama 3.1 405B, we broadly believe that the testing conducted for the 405B model also applies to Llama 3.2 models.\nCommunity\nIndustry Partnerships: Generative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership on AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nGrants: We also set up the Llama Impact Grants program to identify and support the most compelling applications of Meta’s Llama model for societal benefit across three categories: education, climate and open innovation. The 20 finalists from the hundreds of applications can be found here.\nReporting: Finally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nValues: The core values of Llama 3.2 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3.2 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nTesting: Llama 3.2 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3.2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3.2 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.

Well, you can, but most Lavender does best outside. Here is our winter experiment to show you what it would look like. This is one of our 4 Lavender Babies from Fall 2010. Our test specimen is L. x intermedia 'Grosso'.\nLavender can be grown indoors with a bit of effort to keep it in the conditions it loves to thrive. First off begin with choosing a variety that is better able to tolerate the conditions inside a home. To successfully grow Lavender indoors you need to create optimal growing conditions which is hard to do inside a house.\nwhat kind of barley do you malt\nBarley is a wonderfully versatile cereal grain with a rich nutlike flavor and an appealing chewy, pasta-like consistency. Its appearance resembles wheat berries, although it is slightly lighter in color. Sprouted barley is naturally high in maltose, a sugar that serves as the basis for both malt syrup sweetener.\nSpecialty grains that can be used in this way are usually barley, malted or unmalted, that has been treated differently at the malting company. Crystal malt is one of the specialty grains. It is available in a whole range of colors, from 20 to 120 Lovibond. Crystal malt is malted barley that is heated while wet.\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\": [\n1024,\n512,\n256,\n128,\n64,\n32\n],\n\"matryoshka_weights\": [\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1\n],\n\"n_dims_per_step\": -1\n}\nsquad\nDataset: squad at d84c8c2\nSize: 87,599 training samples\nColumns: question and answer\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\nquestion\nanswer\ntype\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 14 charactersmean: 59.66 charactersmax: 150 characters\nmin: 156 charactersmean: 769.53 charactersmax: 3706 characters\nSamples:\nquestion\nanswer\nWhat did Business Insider call San Diego in 2013?\nSan Diego was ranked as the 20th-safest city in America in 2013 by Business Insider. According to Forbes magazine, San Diego was the ninth-safest city in the top 10 list of safest cities in the U.S. in 2010. Like most major cities, San Diego had a declining crime rate from 1990 to 2000. Crime in San Diego increased in the early 2000s. In 2004, San Diego had the sixth lowest crime rate of any U.S. city with over half a million residents. From 2002 to 2006, the crime rate overall dropped 0.8%, though not evenly by category. While violent crime decreased 12.4% during this period, property crime increased 1.1%. Total property crimes per 100,000 people were lower than the national average in 2008.\nWhat did the Spanish call this region?\nThe name Montana comes from the Spanish word Montaña, meaning \"mountain\", or more broadly, \"mountainous country\". Montaña del Norte was the name given by early Spanish explorers to the entire mountainous region of the west. The name Montana was added to a bill by the United States House Committee on Territories, which was chaired at the time by Rep. James Ashley of Ohio, for the territory that would become Idaho Territory. The name was successfully changed by Representatives Henry Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who complained that Montana had \"no meaning\". When Ashley presented a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be carved out of Idaho, he again chose Montana Territory. This time Rep. Samuel Cox, also of Ohio, objected to the name. Cox complained that the name was a misnomer given that most of the territory was not mountainous and that a Native American name would be more appropriate than a Spanish one. Other names such as...\nSmall missiles were designed that could be mounted on what?\nAs this process continued, the missile found itself being used for more and more of the roles formerly filled by guns. First to go were the large weapons, replaced by equally large missile systems of much higher performance. Smaller missiles soon followed, eventually becoming small enough to be mounted on armored cars and tank chassis. These started replacing, or at least supplanting, similar gun-based SPAAG systems in the 1960s, and by the 1990s had replaced almost all such systems in modern armies. Man-portable missiles, MANPADs as they are known today, were introduced in the 1960s and have supplanted or even replaced even the smallest guns in most advanced armies.\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\": [\n1024,\n512,\n256,\n128,\n64,\n32\n],\n\"matryoshka_weights\": [\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1\n],\n\"n_dims_per_step\": -1\n}\ns2orc\nDataset: s2orc at 8cfc394\nSize: 90,000 training samples\nColumns: title and abstract\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\ntitle\nabstract\ntype\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 31 charactersmean: 80.02 charactersmax: 185 characters\nmin: 84 charactersmean: 635.31 charactersmax: 1023 characters\nSamples:\ntitle\nabstract\nModeling Method of Flow Diversion of the Three Outlets in Jingjiang Reach Under Unsteady Flow Conditions\nThe Yangtze River Flood Protection Physical Model is built under the financial support of World Bank loan.Based on theoretical analysis and experimental study,a modeling method of flow diversion of the three outlets in Jingjiang Reach under unsteady flow conditions was established for the model.Validation tests under both steady and unsteady flow conditions manifested that with this modeling method,the experimental flow diversion proves to be consistent with that of the prototype and therefore meets the requirements for precision.Being validated,this modeling method has been applied to Yangtze River Flood Protection Physical Model to study the flood routing features in Jingjiang reach.\nEnlightening on medical administration by clinical governance in British\nMedical quality and safety were the responsibilities of medical system in view of British clinical governance.

First, the AHP is used to construct subjective weights for all criteria and sub-criteria. Then, linguistic values characterized by triangular fuzzy numbers and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to denote the evaluation values of all alternatives with respect to various subjective and objective criteria. Finally, the aggregation fuzzy assessment of different shipping companies is ranked to determine the best selection. Utilizing this fuzzy MCDM model, the decision-maker's fuzzy assessment and the trade-off between various evaluations criteria can be taken into account in the aggregation process, thus ensuring more effective and accurate decision-making.\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\": [\n1024,\n512,\n256,\n128,\n64,\n32\n],\n\"matryoshka_weights\": [\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1\n],\n\"n_dims_per_step\": -1\n}\nallnli\nDataset: allnli at d482672\nSize: 557,850 training samples\nColumns: anchor, positive, and negative\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative\ntype\nstring\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 18 charactersmean: 34.88 charactersmax: 193 characters\nmin: 15 charactersmean: 46.49 charactersmax: 181 characters\nmin: 16 charactersmean: 50.47 charactersmax: 204 characters\nSamples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative\nA person on a horse jumps over a broken down airplane.\nA person is outdoors, on a horse.\nA person is at a diner, ordering an omelette.\nChildren smiling and waving at camera\nThere are children present\nThe kids are frowning\nA boy is jumping on skateboard in the middle of a red bridge.\nThe boy does a skateboarding trick.\nThe boy skates down the sidewalk.\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\": [\n1024,\n512,\n256,\n128,\n64,\n32\n],\n\"matryoshka_weights\": [\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1\n],\n\"n_dims_per_step\": -1\n}\npaq\nDataset: paq at 74601d8\nSize: 64,371,441 training samples\nColumns: query and answer\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\nquery\nanswer\ntype\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 25 charactersmean: 50.56 charactersmax: 104 characters\nmin: 509 charactersmean: 620.96 charactersmax: 773 characters\nSamples:\nquery\nanswer\nin veetla visheshanga ganesh is the husband of\nVeetla Visheshanga a song which reminds Ganga's memory.

However, you could always start at a community college and work your way up. Good Luck\nIf you are not far along in your Army career, education is an especially good way to boost your chances of promotion. Continuing your education at any level can earn you points. For completing your GED or bachelor's degree, you earn 10 points.\nfoods that help with diverticulitis\nDiet for Diverticulitis. Gradually you can ease back into a regular diet. Your doctor may advise you to start with low-fiber foods (white bread, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products) before introducing high-fiber foods. Fiber softens and adds bulk to stools, helping them pass more easily through the colon.\nDuring an attack of diverticulitis, your doctor may recommend a clear liquid diet or a low-fiber diet. This helps the area of infection to heal. Foods allowed on a clear-liquid diet include: 1  Plain water.iverticulitis occurs when small, bulging pouches (diverticula) in your colon become infected and inflamed â causing severe abdominal pain, nausea, and fever. The treatment of a diverticulitis attack will depend on the severity of the symptoms and whether this is your first attack.\ncalories burned in turbo kick class\nThe American Council on Exercise did a study to find out how many calories are burned during a turbo kick class. The study looked at 15 women in a turbo kick class who weighed about 135 lbs and found that they burned between 6.45 to 8.3 calories a minute.

The purpose of this study is to determine the CT slice location where VAT area can best reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight.\n46 patients with psoriasis and 46 sex- and age-matched control patients were included in this study. The abdominal fat area [visceral fat area (VFA), subcutaneous fat area (SFA) and total fat area (TFA)] at the level of the umbilicus was evaluated by computed tomography.\nA retrospective review of CRC patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy at a single center during the period 2006-2009 identified from a prospectively maintained database. Visceral adiposity was determined by measuring visceral fat area (VFA) on preoperative staging CT. All patients were followed up to study completion or death.\nA total of 1941 participants without known cardiovascular disease were enrolled from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. Visceral fat area (VFA) was assessed by computed tomography. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and was used as a percentage of body weight (ASM/Wt). LV structure and function were assessed by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) echocardiography.\nOne hundred and forty nonobese patients (BMI <25 kg/m2) were enrolled. EFV and visceral fat area were measured by MDCT. Patients were classified according to the plaque components (noncalcified, mixed and calcified) and severity of CAD. Inflammatory biomarkers were also measured, and compared with each CT parameter.\nThe blood gas level in each pulmonary vein (PV) was measured in supine subjects with diverse body mass index (BMI) values, to determine whether there was a regional insufficiency in gas exchange depending on the subject's BMI.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 163 patients with cholecystolithiasis and 163 non-cholecystolithiasis control subjects admitted to our institution between March 2011 and September 2013 were included in this cross-sectional evaluation. There were 98 women and 65 men in cholecystolithiasis group with an average age of 57±16 years (range 25-86 years). There were 87 women and 76 men in the control group with an average age of 41±16 years (range 14-77 years). Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and total abdominal adipose tissue (TAT) of all the subjects at navel level were measured on abdominal MRI. According to the visceral adipose area (cut-off point VAT = 100 cm2), study subjects were divided into 1) increased accumulation of intra-abdominal fat and 2) normal distribution of intra-abdominal fat. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of fat with the presence of cholecystolithiasis, adjusted for age and sex.\nWe reviewed the medical records of 106 patients undergoing LA or LESS-A at our institution. Total fat area (TFA) and visceral fat area (VFA) were measured at the level of the L4 vertebra by computed tomography. To categorize the type of obesity, the VFA/TFA ratio was calculated. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of prolonged operative time.\nThe weight gain was 5.2% greater in rats exposed to fructose than in controls (P = 0.042). Total and visceral adipose tissue volumes were 5.2 cm3 (P = 0.017) and 3.1 cm3 (P = 0.019) greater, respectively, while lean tissue volumes did not differ. The level of triglycerides and apolipoprotein A-I was higher (P = 0.034, P = 0.005, respectively) in fructose-exposed rats.\nA total of 1593 middle-aged to older patients participated in this cross-sectional study. Brachial-to-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was measured as an index of arterial stiffness. Second PP (PP2) at the second peak of radial SBP was used to estimate central PP. Radial augmentation index was calculated as PP2/PP. Thigh muscle cross-sectional area and abdominal visceral fat area were quantified by computed tomography. Patients were classified as sarcopenic if their hand grip strength or skeletal muscle mass (measured by bioelectrical impedance) was more than 1 SD lower than the mean of those in a reference group aged below 50 years, or in the lowest 20% of the studied population. Visceral obesity was defined as visceral fat area greater than 100 cm.\nVisceral adiposity is linked with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) (called Syndrome Z), and both correlate with coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of the present study was to determine the significance of excess visceral fat, SDB and circulating levels of biomarkers in CAD in Japanese men.\nThere are no published studies on the impact of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) change on outcomes of restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). The aim of this historic cohort study was to evaluate the impact of excessive VAT gain on the outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with IPAA.\nA subgroup of 46 men (n = 20, aged 29.1-33.4 years) and women (n = 26, aged 29.1-33.8 years) were recruited from an ongoing population study at our institution. Anthropometric variables including weight, height, and waist circumference were measured using standard procedures, and body mass index was calculated (kg/m(2)). Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Plasma apolipoproteins, lipids, glucose, and insulin were measured after an overnight fasting.\nOur aim was to describe adipose tissue content and distribution in ALS patients.\nThis was a cross-sectional study of 140 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 65 ± 11 year; 44.6% women). Visceral fat area (VFA; cm(2) ) and liver attenuation index (LAI) were assessed by abdominal computed tomography. The patients were divided into four groups by VFA and body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2) ) as follows: BMI <25 kg/m(2) and VFA <100 cm(2) (OB[-]VA[-]), BMI ≥25 kg/m(2) and VFA <100 cm(2) (OB[+]VA[-]), BMI <25 kg/m(2) and VFA ≥100 cm(2) (OB[-]VA[+]), and BMI ≥25 kg/m(2) and VFA ≥100 cm(2) (OB[+]VA[+]). Multivariate linear regression and logistic regression analysis were carried out to determine the impact of OB(-)VA(+) on LAI.\nEpicardial adipose tissue represents visceral adiposity, the early detection of which could be helpful for assessing subclinical target organ damage. Although previous studies have reported a relationship between epicardial fat thickness (EFT) and carotid intima-media thickness, there have been no studies detailing the relationship between EFT and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV).\nHigher adiponectin levels were associated with lower risk of diabetes (P < 0.001). Visceral fat was the only adiposity measure associated with diabetes after adjusting for BMI (odds ratio 3.0 [2.1-4.3] in women and 1.3 [1.0-1.6] in men, P < 0.001 between-sex comparison). Adipocytokines attenuated the association between visceral fat and diabetes for both sexes but more strongly in men (women 2.3 [1.5-3.3], men 1.1 [0.9-1.4]). In men, adiponectin, IL-6, and PAI-1 remained independently associated with diabetes after adjusting for fat depots; in women, adiponectin was the only independently associated adipocytokine. Controlling for insulin, HDL, triglycerides, and blood pressure did not change these results.\nNinety obesity patients and 95 non-obesity Uygur individuals were enrolled in this study. CD68 levels in abdominal subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. The cytokine expression levels of adiponectin (APMI) and visfatin in serum were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Infection of 3T3-L1 cells with Ad36 was performed. Real-time PCR was performed to determine expression levels of APMI and Visfatin genes in the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes infected with Ad36.\nSerum CEA levels correlated with visceral fat area, fasting glucose, and triglyceride levels after adjusting for age and BMI. The mean visceral fat area increased significantly with the increasing CEA tirtiles. In a step-wise multiple regression analysis, age (β = 0.26, p<0.01) and visceral fat area (β = 0.19, p = 0.03) were identified as explanatory variables for serum CEA level.\nThe visceral adiposity index (VAI) has proved to be a marker of visceral adipose dysfunction, strongly associated with insulin sensitivity in both the general and specific populations of patients at metabolic risk.\nVisceral adiposity is associated with hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The visceral adiposity index (VAI), a novel marker of visceral fat distribution and dysfunction, has been correlated with histology in hepatitis C. We assessed the ability of VAI to predict disease severity in NAFLD and hence its role as a non-invasive marker of liver damage.\nDo general practitioner hospitals reduce the utilisation of general hospital beds?\nObservational study comparing the total rates of admissions and of occupied bed days in general hospitals between populations with and without access to GP hospitals.

Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of...\nPreoperative range of motion (ROM) has been regarded as one of the most important factors in predicting postoperative ROM following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Mobile-bearing TKA designs have been suggested to possibly improve the knee kinematics compared to fixed-bearing designs. The purpose of this study was to examine the difference in postoperative flexion as a function of preoperative flexion in a consecutive series of TKAs done using a posterior-stabilized rotating-platform prosthesis.\nTo assess the association of underlying diagnosis with outcomes after revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\nWe identified 37 knees diagnosed with osteoarthritis with a preoperative knee flexion ≥120° but a 12-month postoperative range of motion (ROM) ≤110°. A random sample of 111 patients (1:3) from the same database, whose knees had a preoperative and 12-month postoperative ROM ≥120°, based on a diagnosis of primary osteoarthritis and no previous open knee surgery, were selected as the controls.\nThis study reports a series of patients operated on by anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction combined with valgus high tibial osteotomy (HTO) for chronic anterior knee instability associated with medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis. It was hypothesized that the combined surgery would enable return to sport, stabilize the knee and relieve medial pain.\nTo determine the prevalence and factors associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA) defined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and specific OA features on MRI 1 year after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).\nIn anterior ankle arthroscopy, the anterior working area (AWA) is restricted by the presence of the dorsalis pedis artery (DPA) and tendons. Pseudoaneurysms caused by iatrogenic damage to the DPA are difficult to identify intraoperatively. In knee arthroscopy, risk of popliteal artery damage is reduced in the flexed position [1]. This study investigates how DPA movement is affected by dorsiflexion and plantarflexion with the aim of identifying the positions providing the greatest AWA.\nTo investigate whether sex affects the trajectory of functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\nTo determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of tendinopathy in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) could be used to predict the course of tendon involvement in later disease and specifically the risk of tendon rupture.\nWith the advent of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), Synovial lesions around knee are being more and more easily detected. Synovial lesions of knee present with boggy swelling, effusion, pain, and restriction of motion. Differential diagnoses of such lesions include pigmented villonodular synovitis, synovial lipoma, synovial chondromatosis, rheumatoid arthritis, synovial hemangioma, amyloid arthropathy, xanthomata and lipoma arborescens. CT and MRI often help in diagnosis of such lesions. MRI of Lipoma Arborescens has been regarded to have characteristic diagnostic appearance - it includes a synovial mass with frond-like architecture and fat signal intensity on all pulse sequences. Sometimes Lipoma Arborescens can present in conjunction with inflammatory arthritis. Synovectomy is often curative for such conditions.\nJoint trauma can lead to a spectrum of acute lesions, including cartilage degradation, ligament or meniscus tears, and synovitis, all potentially associated with osteoarthritis (OA). This study was undertaken to generate and validate a murine model of knee joint trauma following noninvasive controlled injurious compression in vivo.\nTo determine which subregions of the knee joint have a high prevalence of pre-radiographic osteoarthritic changes, i.e., cartilage damage and osteophytes that can only be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in radiographically normal knees.\n78 of initially 84 patients (80 of 86 knees) were clinically and radiographically reassessed 5 (5.1-5.9) years after conventional, image-based, and image-free total knee arthroplasty. The methodology was identical to that used preoperatively and at 2 years, including the Knee Society score (KSS) and the functional score (FS), and AP and true lateral standard radiographs.\nIn adult patients with trauma, an increase in the thickness of the retropharyngeal soft tissues is commonly used as a potential indicator of occult injury, but no studies have examined this parameter using computed tomography (CT) as a screening modality.\nTo evaluate the thickness of cartilage at the posterior aspect of the medial and lateral condyle in Osteoarthritis (OA) knees compared to non-OA knees using computed tomography arthrography (CTA).\nTotal knee arthroplasty (TKA) successfully alleviates pain from knee osteoarthritis; but deficits in function can persist long term. Despite these well-known deficits, there is little evidence supporting the use of rehabilitation interventions following TKA.\nThe anterior intermeniscal ligament of the knee is at risk during knee arthroscopy, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and tibial nail insertion.\nIt has been previously demonstrated that radiographic severity of arthritis predicts outcome following knee replacement. In certain circumstances, patients may undergo arthroplasty without severe radiographic disease. An example may be the patient with significant chondral damage unsuccessfully treated with arthroscopy. This patient may proceed to joint replacement when their radiographs would not normally merit such intervention. We investigated whether these findings were also applicable to total ankle replacements (TARs).\nThere is an increasing body of evidence that magnetic resonance imaging-occult tissue damage is an important component of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) pathology. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) can be used to measure in vivo whole-brain N-acetylaspartate (WBNAA) concentrations, the decrease of whose levels is considered a marker of neuronal-axonal injury.\nMeniscectomy and articular cartilage damage have been found to increase the prevalence of osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, but the effect of knee range of motion has not been extensively studied.\nPatients 50 years and older with knee osteoarthritis who underwent arthroscopy between 1998 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and an annual arthroscopy rate was calculated from 1998 through 2002 and from 2006 through 2010. Patients who underwent knee arthroplasty within 2 years of arthroscopy during each period were identified, and a 2-year conversion to arthroplasty rate was calculated.\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\": [\n1024,\n512,\n256,\n128,\n64,\n32\n],\n\"matryoshka_weights\": [\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1\n],\n\"n_dims_per_step\": -1\n}\nmiracl\nDataset: miracl at 07e2b62\nSize: 789,900 training samples\nColumns: anchor, positive, and negative\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative\ntype\nstring\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 11 charactersmean: 39.23 charactersmax: 129 characters\nmin: 72 charactersmean: 745.86 charactersmax: 4292 characters\nmin: 18 charactersmean: 649.52 charactersmax: 3570 characters\nSamples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative\nWho created The Walking Dead comic books?\nDays Gone Bye (The Walking Dead)Robert Kirkman, the creator of the eponymous series of comic books, considered the idea of creating a television show based on the comic series, but did not move forward. Frank Darabont expressed interest in developing the series for television. In January 2010, AMC formally announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series adapted from \"The Walking Dead\" comic book. In the announcement, the executives stated that Darabont would serve as writer, director, and an executive producer alongside Gale Anne Hurd.\nLiving DeadThe Walking Dead\nWhen was the first car invented?\nCarIn 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first \"Motorwagen\" was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz & Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a model intended for affordability. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888 Bertha Benz, the wife of Karl B...\nElwood HaynesIn 1905, three years after the Apperson brothers split from Haynes, Haynes-Apperson was renamed the Haynes Automobile Company and Haynes launched a series of publicity campaigns. A parade of 2,000 cars was organized in New York City during 1908 and Haynes, whom many recognized as the inventor of the American automobile, led the parade down Broadway riding in the \"Pioneer\". He was followed by ten Haynes cars, a model from each year to display the advancement in technology. On his way to the parade, Haynes was unaware of the city's newly established speeding laws and was arrested for driving too fast—in a car with a top speed of 15 mph (17 km/h)—and taken to jail. He was soon able to see a magistrate who released him after learning that he was Elwood Haynes and had come to lead the parade.

Since the show's inception in 1963, the character has been portrayed by thirteen lead actors. In the programme, \"the Doctor\" is the alias assumed by a centuries-old alien—a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey—who travels through space and time in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. The transition to each succeeding actor is explained within the show's narrative through the plot device of \"regeneration\", a biological function of the Time Lord race that allows a change of cellular structure and appearance with recovery following a potentially fatal injury.\nSixth DoctorThe Sixth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". He is portrayed by Colin Baker. Although his televisual time on the series was comparatively brief and turbulent, Baker has continued as the Sixth Doctor in Big Finish's range of original \"Doctor Who\" audio adventures. Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change. Baker portrays the sixth such incarnation, an arrogant, flamboyant character in brightly coloured, mismatched clothes whose brash, often patronising personality set him apart from all his previous incarnations.\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\": [\n1024,\n512,\n256,\n128,\n64,\n32\n],\n\"matryoshka_weights\": [\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1\n],\n\"n_dims_per_step\": -1\n}\nmldr\nDataset: mldr at 40ad767\nSize: 200,000 training samples\nColumns: anchor, positive, and negative\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative\ntype\nstring\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 17 charactersmean: 65.31 charactersmax: 210 characters\nmin: 2432 charactersmean: 20354.29 charactersmax: 123500 characters\nmin: 3035 charactersmean: 16236.77 charactersmax: 166364 characters\nSamples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative\nWhen was the art museum in Santa Barbara first opened to the public?\nThe Santa Barbara Museum of Art (SBMA) is an art museum located in downtown Santa Barbara, California.Founded in 1941, it is home to both permanent and special collections, the former of which includes Asian, American, and European art that spans 4,000 years from ancient to modern.HistoryThe Santa Barbara Museum of Art opened to the public on June 5, 1941, in a building that was at one time the Santa Barbara Post Office (1914–1932). The idea for an art museum first came from the local artist Colin Campbell Cooper when he learned that the post office was going to be sold. In a letter to the editor published in the Santa Barbara News-Press in July 1937, Cooper proposed that the impressive Italianate structure should be transformed into a museum. After gaining momentum in town and with the support of local businesses, politicians and art collectors the Santa Barbara Museum of Art was officially established just four years after Cooper's letter was published. The renowned Chicago arc...\nThe Knott's Berry Farm amusement park in Orange County, California, originated from a berry farm owned by Walter Knott (1889–1981). In the 1920s, Knott and his wife, Cordelia, sold berries, berry preserves and pies from a roadside stand beside State Route 39, near the small town of Buena Park.In 1932, on a visit to Rudolph Boysen's farm in nearby Anaheim, Walter Knott was introduced to a new hybrid berry of a blackberry, a red raspberry, and a loganberry cross-bred by Boysen, who gave Walter his last six wilted berry-hybrid plants. Walter planted and cultivated them, then the family sold the berries at their roadside stand. When people asked what kind they were, he called them \"boysenberries\".In 1934, to make ends meet, Knott's wife Cordelia (1890–1974) reluctantly began serving fried chicken dinners on their wedding china. For dessert, Knott's signature Boysenberry Pie was also served to guests dining in the small tea room. As Southern California developed, Highway 39 became the ma...\nWhat is the objective of Opération Chammal?\nOpération Chammal is a French military operation in Iraq and Syria in an attempt to contain the expansion of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and to support the Iraqi Army. Its name comes from the Shamal (Chammal in French), a northwesterly wind that blows over Iraq and the Persian Gulf states.Airstrikes over Iraq started 19 September 2014 and airstrikes over Syria started by the end of September 2015. The French operation is limited to airstrikes; French president François Hollande has reiterated that no ground troops would be used in the conflict. Additionally, the French frigate  has joined the United States Navy's Commander Task Force 50 (CTF 50) as an escort.On 14 November 2015, ISIL claimed that the attacks that took place in Paris the previous day were retaliation for Opération Chammal. In response, French forces increased their attacks against ISIL in Syria.Background On 10 June 2014, the terrorist group of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and several ot...\nCMA CGM S.A. is a French container transportation and shipping company. It is the world’s 3rd largest container shipping company, using 257 shipping routes between 420 ports in 160 different countries.

The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused.[2] There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an accident or operation.[3] In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store into the long-term store. People with this type of amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. These two types are not mutually exclusive; both can occur simultaneously.\nAmnesiaHead trauma is a very broad range as it deals with any kind of injury or active action toward the brain which might cause amnesia. Retrograde and anterograde amnesia is more often seen from events like this, an exact example of a cause of the two would be electroconvulsive therapy, which would cause both briefly for the receiving patient. Traumatic events are more subjective. What is traumatic is dependent on what the person finds to be traumatic. Regardless, a traumatic event is an event where something so distressing occurs that the mind chooses to forget rather than deal with the stress. A common example of amnesia that is caused by traumatic events is dissociative amnesia, which occurs when the person forgets an event that has deeply disturbed them.[8] An example would be a person forgetting a fatal and graphic car accident involving their loved ones. Physical deficiencies are different from head trauma because physical deficiencies lean more toward passive physical issues.\nWhat is the largest naval base in the world?\nNaval Station NorfolkNaval Station Norfolk, is a United States Navy base in Norfolk, Virginia. It supports naval forces in the United States Fleet Forces Command,[1] those operating in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean. The installation occupies about 4 miles (6.4km) of waterfront space and 11 miles (18km) of pier and wharf space of the Hampton Roads peninsula known as Sewell's Point. It is the world's largest naval station, with the largest concentration of U.S. Navy forces through 75 ships alongside 14 piers and with 134 aircraft and 11 aircraft hangars at the adjacently operated Chambers Field and [2] Port Services controls more than 3,100 ships' movements annually as they arrive and depart their berths.\nClark Air BaseClark Air Base was arguably the most urbanized military facility in history and was the largest American base overseas.

The battery stands before a great lake of blood from which he forms his red power ring (crystallized by his anger), as well as other rings and batteries used to form the Red Lantern Corps. Harnessing the red light of rage, he sends his rings out into the universe; however, upon accepting the rings, his recruits' hearts are rendered useless. Their blood spoils from within, forcing them to expel the violently flammable and corrosive material from their mouths. Additionally, the Red Lanterns are reduced to an almost animalistic state, with only Atrocitus appearing to be in full control of himself. Once Atrocitus assembles a sufficient force, he leads them on a mission to capture Sinestro (who is being transferred to Korugar for his execution). Coincidentally, the Sinestro Corps ...\nGreen Lantern in other mediaJohn Stewart is a member of the Justice League in the \"Justice League\" animated series. In this series, Stewart's ring was initially constrained to permitting him to fly, generating a protective force field, creating walls, and firing energy blasts; this limitation was established as being due to Stewart's mindset, not an inherent limitation of the ring itself (the series' version of Stewart is a former U.S. Marine, not an architect). After being berated by Katma Tui for his unimaginative use of the ring, Stewart has learned to generate complex tools (to defuse a bomb in one instance) and weapons. (He was also shown to be more creative when transformed into a child in the episode \"Kids Stuff\".) In a development not seen in any other version of the Green Lantern mythos, Stewart's eyes glow green when wearing his charged power ring. The glow fades when the ring runs out of power. The series has been inconsistent about the ring's effectiveness against yellow; ...\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\": [\n1024,\n512,\n256,\n128,\n64,\n32\n],\n\"matryoshka_weights\": [\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1\n],\n\"n_dims_per_step\": -1\n}\nEvaluation Datasets\ngooaq\nDataset: gooaq at b089f72\nSize: 3,012,496 evaluation samples\nColumns: question and answer\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\nquestion\nanswer\ntype\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 18 charactersmean: 43.17 charactersmax: 98 characters\nmin: 51 charactersmean: 254.12 charactersmax: 360 characters\nSamples:\nquestion\nanswer\nhow do i program my directv remote with my tv?\n['Press MENU on your remote.', 'Select Settings & Help > Settings > Remote Control > Program Remote.', 'Choose the device (TV, audio, DVD) you wish to program. ...

Many wars, and especially the Thirty Years' War, disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times. War, plague, famine, regicide, and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts. This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state. As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and m...\nWhen did Jewish law recognize copyright?\nThe concept's origins can potentially be traced back further.

We have (i) reviewed recent studies linking markers of subclinical organ damage in the heart, blood vessels and kidney to cardiovascular risk; (ii) discussed the evidence for improvement in cardiovascular risk prediction using markers of subclinical organ damage; (iii) investigated which and how many markers to measure and (iv) finally discussed whether measuring subclinical organ damage provided benefits beyond risk prediction. In conclusion, more studies and if possible randomized studies are needed to investigate (i) the importance of markers of subclinical organ damage for risk discrimination, calibration and reclassification; and (ii) the econom...\nA Novel Approach to Simulate Climate Change Impacts on Vascular Epiphytes: Case Study in Taiwan\nIn the wet tropics, epiphytes form a conspicuous layer in the forest canopy, support abundant coexisting biota, and are known to have a critical influence on forest hydrology and nutrient cycling. Since canopy-dwelling plants have no vascular connection to the ground or their host plants, they are likely more sensitive to environmental changes than their soil-rooted counterparts, subsequently regarded as one of the groups most vulnerable to global climate change. Epiphytes have adapted to life in highly dynamic forest canopies by producing many, mostly wind-dispersed, seeds or spores. Consequently, epiphytes should colonize trees rapidly, which, in addition to atmospheric sensitivity and short life cycles, make epiphytes suitable climate change indicators. In this study, we assess the impact of climate change on Taiwanese epiphytes using a modeling approach.\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\": [\n1024,\n512,\n256,\n128,\n64,\n32\n],\n\"matryoshka_weights\": [\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1\n],\n\"n_dims_per_step\": -1\n}\nallnli\nDataset: allnli at d482672\nSize: 6,584 evaluation samples\nColumns: anchor, positive, and negative\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative\ntype\nstring\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 15 charactersmean: 72.82 charactersmax: 300 characters\nmin: 12 charactersmean: 34.11 charactersmax: 126 characters\nmin: 11 charactersmean: 36.38 charactersmax: 121 characters\nSamples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative\nTwo women are embracing while holding to go packages.\nTwo woman are holding packages.\nThe men are fighting outside a deli.\nTwo young children in blue jerseys, one with the number 9 and one with the number 2 are standing on wooden steps in a bathroom and washing their hands in a sink.\nTwo kids in numbered jerseys wash their hands.\nTwo kids in jackets walk to school.\nA man selling donuts to a customer during a world exhibition event held in the city of Angeles\nA man selling donuts to a customer.\nA woman drinks her coffee in a small cafe.\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\": [\n1024,\n512,\n256,\n128,\n64,\n32\n],\n\"matryoshka_weights\": [\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1\n],\n\"n_dims_per_step\": -1\n}\npaq\nDataset: paq at 74601d8\nSize: 64,371,441 evaluation samples\nColumns: query and answer\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\nquery\nanswer\ntype\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 25 charactersmean: 51.3 charactersmax: 108 characters\nmin: 504 charactersmean: 623.09 charactersmax: 835 characters\nSamples:\nquery\nanswer\nwhen did season 3 of the voice brasil start\nThe Voice Brasil (season 3) The third season of \"The Voice Brasil\", premiered on Rede Globo on September 18, 2014 in the 10:30 p.m. (BRT/AMT) slot immediately following the primetime telenovela \"Império\".

It encodes a constant (C) segment of Immunoglobulin A heavy chain. Immunoglobulin A is an antibody that plays a critical role in immune function in the mucous membranes. IgA shows the same typical structure of other antibody classes, with two heavy chains and two light chains, and four distinct domains: one variable region, and three variable regions. As a major class of immunoglobulin in body secretions, IgA plays a role in defending against infection, as well as preventing the access of foreign antigens to the immunologic system.\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\": [\n1024,\n512,\n256,\n128,\n64,\n32\n],\n\"matryoshka_weights\": [\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1\n],\n\"n_dims_per_step\": -1\n}\npubmedqa\nDataset: pubmedqa at a1ef0b5\nSize: 1,660 evaluation samples\nColumns: anchor, positive, negative_1, negative_2, negative_3, negative_4, negative_5, negative_6, negative_7, negative_8, negative_9, negative_10, negative_11, negative_12, negative_13, negative_14, negative_15, negative_16, negative_17, negative_18, negative_19, and negative_20\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative_1\nnegative_2\nnegative_3\nnegative_4\nnegative_5\nnegative_6\nnegative_7\nnegative_8\nnegative_9\nnegative_10\nnegative_11\nnegative_12\nnegative_13\nnegative_14\nnegative_15\nnegative_16\nnegative_17\nnegative_18\nnegative_19\nnegative_20\ntype\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 38 charactersmean: 88.92 charactersmax: 140 characters\nmin: 12 charactersmean: 372.72 charactersmax: 1113 characters\nmin: 26 charactersmean: 371.1 charactersmax: 1185 characters\nmin: 20 charactersmean: 326.89 charactersmax: 1084 characters\nmin: 23 charactersmean: 334.62 charactersmax: 1477 characters\nmin: 13 charactersmean: 347.64 charactersmax: 1310 characters\nmin: 13 charactersmean: 337.96 charactersmax: 1221 characters\nmin: 13 charactersmean: 303.39 charactersmax: 953 characters\nmin: 14 charactersmean: 328.25 charactersmax: 1168 characters\nmin: 16 charactersmean: 318.59 charactersmax: 989 characters\nmin: 18 charactersmean: 284.81 charactersmax: 853 characters\nmin: 13 charactersmean: 333.89 charactersmax: 875 characters\nmin: 26 charactersmean: 327.33 charactersmax: 1041 characters\nmin: 19 charactersmean: 354.74 charactersmax: 1705 characters\nmin: 16 charactersmean: 334.33 charactersmax: 1593 characters\nmin: 18 charactersmean: 346.0 charactersmax: 1374 characters\nmin: 13 charactersmean: 367.52 charactersmax: 1625 characters\nmin: 17 charactersmean: 357.96 charactersmax: 1126 characters\nmin: 23 charactersmean: 322.84 charactersmax: 1060 characters\nmin: 25 charactersmean: 312.1 charactersmax: 805 characters\nmin: 22 charactersmean: 362.97 charactersmax: 1002 characters\nmin: 22 charactersmean: 328.62 charactersmax: 1310 characters\nSamples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative_1\nnegative_2\nnegative_3\nnegative_4\nnegative_5\nnegative_6\nnegative_7\nnegative_8\nnegative_9\nnegative_10\nnegative_11\nnegative_12\nnegative_13\nnegative_14\nnegative_15\nnegative_16\nnegative_17\nnegative_18\nnegative_19\nnegative_20\nChronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome?\nObservational study, with a comparison control group.\nNasal nitric oxide (NO) and olfactory function are decreased in patients with chronic inflammatory sinonasal disease, suggesting a link between these two parameters. The aim of the study was to investigate nasal NO levels in patients with olfactory dysfunction due to different causes.\nFibromyalgia (FM) is a worldwide diffuse musculoskeletal chronic pain condition that affects up to 5% of the general population. Many symptoms associated with mitochondrial diseases are reported in patients with FM such as exercise intolerance, fatigue, myopathy and mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we report a mutation in cytochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in a family with FM with inflammasome complex activation.\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has an uncertain pathogenesis. Allergies have been suggested as one cause.\nPatient's self-reported symptoms on a structured case history questionnaire.\nChronic multisymptom illness (reporting at least one symptom in at least two of the following symptom constructs: general fatigue; mood and cognition problems; and musculoskeletal discomfort) was assessed, differentiating by potential burn pit exposure, among deployers who completed 2004 and 2007 Millennium Cohort questionnaires.\nfunctional decline and death.\nOlfactory loss is a debilitating symptom of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The pathophysiology of inflammatory olfactory dysfunction likely involves both conductive and sensorineural components. To study the interaction of CRS-associated inflammatory cytokines with the olfactory epithelium (OE), a transgenic mouse model was developed that allows temporally-controlled local gene expression. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a prototypical T helper 1 (Th1) cytokine linked to nonpolypoid CRS (CRSsNP), as well as sinonasal viral and bacterial infections. In this study, the effects of chronic IFN-γ expression on olfactory histology and function were investigated.\nMonosomy 1p36 syndrome is the most commonly observed subtelomeric deletion syndrome. Patients with this syndrome typically have common clinical features, such as intellectual disability, epilepsy, and characteristic craniofacial features.\nMigraine is frequently accompanied by symptoms consistent with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). This study evaluated the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal symptoms and assessed the symptoms' relationship with the concomitant functional symptoms of anxiety, depression, and headache-related disability.\nThe 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are often assumed to suggest low-grade systemic inflammation, but have never been formally validated. This study explored the content validity of the Criteria in a sample of adolescents with CFS selected according to a wide case definition.\nIrritable pouch syndrome (IPS) is a functional disorder in patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), which presents with symptoms in the absence of structural abnormalities of the pouch. Thus, it resembles other functional disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome characterized by visceral hypersensitivity in the presence of normal rectal biomechanics. The aim was to assess pouch biomechanics and perception of balloon distension in different groups of subjects with IPAA and to correlate the findings with clinical features.\nFibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) frequently overlap clinically and have been considered variants of one common disorder. We have recently shown that CFS is associated with a short corrected electrocardiographic QT interval (QTc). In the present study, we evaluated whether FM and CFS can be distinguished by QTc.\nSingle case with clinical follow-up over 2 years.\nFibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a disease of unknown pathogenesis characterized by chronic musculoskeletal pain. FMS has been also associated with altered endocrinological responses, but findings are inconsistent.\nPrimary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic rheumatic disease in which gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common. Faecal calprotectin (FC) is a non-invasive biomarker that has been suggested to discriminate organic intestinal disease from functional disorders. The purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness of FC testing in patients with pSS.\nAn inactive lifestyle has been associated with functional somatic symptoms (FSS), but findings are contradictory. Moreover, mediating factors in this relationship are unclear. We examined whether low physical activity was related to FSS in adolescents, and whether this association was mediated by low physical fitness.\nNephrotic syndrome is a common kidney disease in both children and adults that is characterized by dramatic structural changes in the actin-rich foot processes of glomerular podocytes. Although glucocorticoids are the primary treatment for nephrotic syndrome, neither the target cell nor mechanism of action of glucocorticoids in nephrotic syndrome is known. For the last 30 years glucocorticoids have been presumed to act by reducing the release of soluble mediators of disease by circulating lymphocytes. In contrast, we hypothesized that glucocorticoids exert their beneficial effects in nephrotic syndrome by direct action on podocytes.\nChronic sclerosing sialadenitis is a fibroinflammatory disease of the salivary glands, characteristically of the submandibular gland. One prior Asian study proposed that chronic sclerosing sialadenitis is a part of the spectrum of IgG4-associated disease. This association has not been confirmed in Western populations. We therefore, investigated the relationship between IgG4 and chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, and compared the histomorphologic features of this condition with those of chronic sialadenitis-not otherwise specified, Sjögren syndrome, and lymphoepithelial sialadenitis.\nPresence of GI symptoms.\nDisrupted-in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), identified in a pedigree with a familial psychosis with the chromosome translocation (1:11), is a putative susceptibility gene for psychoses such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) report having continuous severe fatigue and many overlapping symptoms with MDD; however, the mechanism and effective treatment of CFS are still unclear. We focused on the overlapping symptoms between CFS and MDD and performed an association study of the functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the DISC1 gene with CFS.\nDoes sonographic needle guidance affect the clinical outcome of intraarticular injections?\nIn total, 148 painful joints were randomized to IA triamcinolone acetonide injection by conventional palpation-guided anatomic injection or sonographic image-guided injection enhanced with a one-handed control syringe (the reciprocating device). A one-needle, 2-syringe technique was used, where the first syringe was used to introduce the needle, aspirate any effusion, and anesthetize and dilate the IA space with lidocaine. After IA placement and synovial space dilation were confirmed, a syringe exchange was performed, and corticosteroid was injected with the second syringe through the indwelling IA needle. Baseline pain, procedural pain, pain at outcome (2 weeks), and changes in pain scores were measured with a 0-10 cm visual analog pain scale (VAS).\nWe used a blinded, longitudinal observational design of effectiveness in an effort to determine the accuracy of intra-articular injections and the effect of that accuracy on pain and functional outcomes in patients with various shoulder pathologies.\nData from standardized procedure notes and postprocedure chest radiographs were extracted and individually reviewed to verify the presence of pneumothorax or misplacement, and any intervention performed for either complication. The overall success rate of ultrasound-guided right internal jugular vein central venous catheter placement was 96.9% with an average of 1.3 attempts. There was only one pneumothorax (0.1% [95% CI, 0-0.4%]), and the rate of catheter misplacement requiring repositioning or replacement was 1.0% (95% CI, 0.6-1.7%). There were no arterial placements found on chest radiographs. Multivariate regression analysis showed no correlation between high-risk patient characteristics and composite complication rate.\nReal-time ultrasound-guided techniques allow for improved cannulation of the internal jugular vein and femoral vein for hemodialysis; however, these techniques require extra sterilization procedures, specialized probes, or needle guides. A simpler ultrasound vessel localization method was performed to investigate whether this alternative approach would aid in the cannulation of the femoral vein for patients in whom temporary angioaccess was required for hemodialysis.\nTo determine whether duration or venue of intravenous antibiotic administration affect lung function.\nNeedle electromyography (NEE) would be more valuable if it could predict outcomes after lumbar epidural steroid injections (LESIs) in lumbosacral radiculopathy (LSR).\nAmong patients with Wilkes stage III and IV disease undergoing arthroscopic lysis and lavage, does the use of an intra-articular injection of sodium hyaluronate (SH), when compared with Ringer lavage, result in better postoperative pain control and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function?\nIntraoperative MR imaging and sonography are used for navigation during neurosurgical procedures. The purpose of this experimental study was to evaluate the potential of high-resolution sonography using superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles as a contrast medium to delineate brain tumors and to relate these findings with those of MR imaging.\nAcademic general internal medicine practice.\nTo evaluate how guidance on water-intake impacts the degree of nocturia.\nIntra-articular knee injections are commonly performed in clinical practice for treating various knee joint disorders such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. When selecting the portal for injection, not only intra-articular needle accuracy but also procedural pain should be taken into consideration. The purpose of this study was to determine whether injection through anterolateral portal provokes less pain and provides better pain relief compared to superolateral portal.\nUltrasound guidance reduces the required local anesthetic volume for successful peripheral nerve blockade, but it is unclear whether this impacts postoperative analgesia. This prospective, randomized, observer-blinded study tested the hypothesis that a low-volume ultrasound-guided ankle block would provide similar analgesia after foot surgery compared with a conventional-volume surface landmark technique.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate how intravascular ultrasound-determined thickness and reflectivity of the inner echogenic layer of coronary artery plaque is affected by changes in collagen, elastin, proteoglycan, calcium and lipid content in the intima and media.\nThe anesthetic requirement is decreased in animals with head injury, but there are no data regarding the effect of intracranial tumor on the potency for intravenous anesthetics. The authors compared the quantal dose-response curves for propofol in patients having large (> or = 30 mm, mass effect) brain tumor with those having smaller (< 30 mm) lesions and with control patients undergoing noncranial surgery.\nTo develop digital multimedia instruction on intraoral suturing.\nTo evaluate a long term efficiency of a deep sclerectomy with T-Flux implant on intraocular pressure\nIn bilateral cochlear implant users, electrodes mapped to the same frequency range in each ear may stimulate different places in each cochlea due to an insertion depth difference of electrode arrays. This interaural place of stimulation mismatch can lead to problems with auditory image fusion and sensitivity to binaural cues, which may explain the large localization errors seen in many patients. Previous work has shown that interaural place of stimulation mismatch can lead to off-centered auditory images being perceived even though interaural time and level differences (ITD and ILD, respectively) were zero. Large interaural mismatches reduced the ability to use ITDs for auditory image lateralization. In contrast, lateralization with ILDs was still possible but the mapping of ILDs to spatial locations was distorted. This study extends the previous work by systematically investigating the effect of interaural place of stimulation mismatch on ITD and ILD sensitivity directly and examining...\nMathematical modeling and use of real world clinical inputs.\nThe use of ultrasonography in regional anesthetic blocks has rapidly evolved over the past few years. It has been speculated that ultrasound guidance might increase success rates and reduce complications. The aim of our study is to compare the success rate and quality of interscalene brachial plexus blocks performed either with direct ultrasound visualization or with the aid of nerve stimulation to guide needle placement.\nIntra-operative nerve monitoring (IONM) of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) during thyroid and parathyroid surgery is thought to aid in identification and dissection of the RLN. While utilization of IONM is increasing, one area of variability in its application is the assessment of adequate endotracheal tube electrode placement for IONM during the case. The main objective of this study is to assess the overall success of utilizing respiratory variation to confirm proper endotracheal tube placement for RLN monitoring.\nTime-dependent development of intracochlear impedances was investigated in 4 different groups of adult patients up to 4 years after implantation. Additionally, during rehabilitation period just after first fitting, impedances before and after stimulation were measured as to investigate the influence of electrical stimulation on the impedances. Results from standard Nucleus 24 Contour (control), standard Nucleus 24 Contour with intraoperative application of steroids, iridium-coated Nucleus 24 Contour, and iridium-coated Nucleus 24 Contour with intraoperative application of steroids were compared.\nDoes type 1 diabetes mellitus affect Achilles tendon response to a 10 km run?\nParticipants were 7 individuals with T1DM and 10 controls. All regularly ran distances greater than 5 km and VISA-A scores indicated good tendon function (T1DM = 94 ± 11, control = 94 ± 10). There were no diabetic complications and HbA1c was 8.7 ± 2.6 mmol/mol for T1DM and 5.3 ± 0.4 mmol/mol for control groups. Baseline tendon structure was similar in T1DM and control groups - UTC echo-types (I-IV) and anterior-posterior thickness were all p > 0.05. No response to load was seen in either T1DM or control group over the 4-days post exercise.\nThe inability to produce insulin endogenously precipitates the clinical symptoms of type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, the dynamic trajectory of beta cell destruction following onset remains unclear. Using model-based inference, the severity of beta cell destruction at onset decreases with age where, on average, a 40% reduction in beta cell mass was sufficient to precipitate clinical symptoms at 20 years of age. While plasma C-peptide provides a surrogate measure of endogenous insulin production post-onset, it is unclear as to whether plasma C-peptide represents changes in beta cell mass or beta cell function. The objective of this paper was to determine the relationship between beta cell mass and endogenous insulin production post-onset.\nSeven healthy individuals with type 1 diabetes were tested on two separate occasions, during which either a 30-min MOD or IHE protocol was performed. MOD consisted of continuous exercise at 40% Vo(2peak), while the IHE protocol involved a combination of continuous exercise at 40% Vo(2peak) interspersed with 4-s sprints performed every 2 min to simulate the activity patterns of team sports.\nIt is unclear how genetic type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) influences infarct size when blood glucose is tightly controlled. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of genetic type 1 DM, as occurs in BB rats, on infarct size after transient unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in male and female rats. In addition, studies suggest that male type 1 DM rats have a higher incidence of end-organ complications than do females. A second aim of this study was to determine the effect of chronic 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) administration on infarct size in male BB rats.\nStudies on bone mineral characteristics in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have generated conflicting results.\nIt has recently been reported that the risk of developing nephropathy in patients with insulin dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with synergism between poor glycaemic control and carriage of the hypertension associated angiotensin II (type 1) receptor C1166 allele. The same report also revealed an increase in risk of nephropathy in diabetic patients carrying a specific angiotensin II (type 1) receptor haplotype, i.e. C1166/140-bp microsatellite allele (major allele).\nThe angiotensin II (type 1) (AT1) receptor mediates many biological effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), leading to remodelling of cardiac tissue. The present study was designed to analyse changes in the function and expression of the AT1 receptor as principal effector of the RAS in myocardium from type 2 diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic myocardium as control. In addition, we determined the effect of treatment with ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor blockers on expression levels of the receptor in diabetic patients.\nType 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Antioxidative properties of high density lipoprotein (HDL) are important for atheroprotection. This study investigated whether the antioxidative functionality of HDL is altered in type 2 diabetes mellitus and aimed to identify potential determinants of this parameter.\nLife-long insulin is the standard treatment for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The role of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in T1DM is still not clear. The aim of this study is to explore the prescription pattern of TCM and its impact on the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients with T1DM.\nIn type 1 diabetes, lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DL(CO)) may be impaired, and insulin has been shown to be beneficial in cases in which near-normal metabolic control is achieved. An influence of insulin, per se, on the alveolar-capillary membrane conductance is unexplored. We aimed at testing this possibility.\naIMT, but not cIMT, was significantly greater in the children with type 1 diabetes mellitus than in control subjects (P < .001). In children with type 1 diabetes mellitus, aIMT correlated with glycosylated hemoglobin (r = 0.31, P = .01) and was independently associated with age (beta = 0.38, P = .001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (beta = 0.38, P = .001). Vascular function (GTN) was worse in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus who had an aIMT >95th percentile, as defined with the control subjects.\nType 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is caused by specific destruction of the pancreatic beta cells in the islets of Langerhans. Increased sensitivity to cytokines, in particular to interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) seems to be an acquired trait during beta-cell maturation. In response to cytokines both protective and deleterious mechanisms are induced in beta cells, and when the deleterious prevail, T1DM develops. The aims of this study were to identify perturbation in protein patterns (PiPP) associated with beta-cell maturation, and compare these changes to previous analyses of IL-1beta exposed rat islets. For this purpose, proteome analyses were carried out using a cell-line, which matures from a glucagon-producing pre-beta-cell phenotype (NHI-glu) to an insulin-producing beta-cell phenotype (NHI-ins). We have previously shown that this maturation is accompanied by acquired sensitivity to the toxic effects of IL-1beta.\nType 1 diabetes mellitus is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease that leads to a major loss of insulin-secreting beta cells. The further decline of beta-cell function after clinical onset might be prevented by treatment with CD3 monoclonal antibodies, as suggested by the results of a phase 1 study. To provide proof of this therapeutic principle at the metabolic level, we initiated a phase 2 placebo-controlled trial with a humanized antibody, an aglycosylated human IgG1 antibody directed against CD3 (ChAglyCD3).\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects approximately 10% of Americans, while 79 million Americans are estimated to have glucose intolerance or prediabetes (pre-DM). The present study was designed to determine whether obese patients with pre-DM or T2DM would lose weight as effectively as obese normoglycemic patients, in a medically supervised high-protein, low-calorie-weight management program.\nWe have previously shown that long-term type 1 diabetes affects the structural organization, contractile apparatus and extracellular matrix (ECM) of the myometrium during early pregnancy in mice.\nIn Achilles injured participants, there was a significant difference between soleus and lateral gastrocnemius offset times during running compared to the asymptomatic controls (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in triceps surae muscle activity between the footwear only and footwear and orthoses condition in the Achilles injured participants.\nNine adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (five males, four females, aged 16 +/- 1.8 yr, diabetes duration 8.2 +/- 4.1 yr, hemoglobin A1c 7.8 +/- 0.8%, mean +/- SD) were subjected on two different occasions to a rest or 45 min of exercise at 95% of their lactate threshold. Insulin was administered iv at a rate based on their usual insulin dose, with similar plasma insulin levels for both studies (82.1 +/- 19.0, exercise vs. 82.7 +/- 16.4 pmol/liter, rest). Glucose was infused to maintain euglycemia for 18 h.\nType 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is influenced by genetic as well as environmental factors. Its incidence has risen considerably since the 1950s.\nInsulin resistance has been associated with hypertension and with renal complications in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Causal relationships have not been fully explained.\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is a common metabolic disease among the middle-aged and older population, which leads to an increase of stroke incidence and poor stroke recovery. The present study was designed to investigate the impact of DM on brain damage and on ischemic brain repair after stroke in aging animals.\nType 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease with multiple susceptibility genes. The aim of this study was to determine whether combining IDDM1/HLA and IDDM2/ insulin( INS) 5' variable number of tandem repeat locus (VNTR) genotypes improves T1D risk assessment.\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\": [\n1024,\n512,\n256,\n128,\n64,\n32\n],\n\"matryoshka_weights\": [\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1\n],\n\"n_dims_per_step\": -1\n}\nmiracl\nDataset: miracl at 07e2b62\nSize: 789,900 evaluation samples\nColumns: anchor, positive, and negative\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative\ntype\nstring\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 11 charactersmean: 38.08 charactersmax: 86 characters\nmin: 93 charactersmean: 746.58 charactersmax: 3851 characters\nmin: 18 charactersmean: 648.12 charactersmax: 2554 characters\nSamples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative\nWhat was Paul Heyman's first production?\nPaul HeymanOn May 23, 2005, Heyman returned in a segment with Vince McMahon and Eric Bischoff announcing ECW One Night Stand, with Heyman in charge. On the May 22 episode of \"Raw\", Heyman appeared as ECW Representative promoting \"One Night Stand\". On May 25, 2006 it was announced that ECW would relaunch, as a third WWE brand. Heyman was in charge of the new brand on-camera but had minimal creative input off-camera as well. On the May 29 episode of \"Raw\", during a face-off with Mick Foley, Heyman announced that he was granted a draft pick from both Raw and SmackDown! by Vince McMahon. His Raw draft pick was former ECW wrestler (and Money in the Bank contract holder) Rob Van Dam, and his SmackDown! draft pick was Kurt Angle. Heyman predicted that Van Dam would defeat John Cena at \"One Night Stand\" for the WWE Championship and then declare himself the new ECW World Heavyweight Champion.\nJay WolpertWolpert left Goodson-Todman to form his own production company, and his first game show was the 1979 series \"Whew!\" for CBS. Wolpert produced the series with Burt Sugarman for most of its run. \"Whew!\" was canceled in 1980 and Wolpert did not return to television with a series until January 1983, despite shooting several pilots in the interim. On January 3, 1983, Wolpert's \"Hit Man\" debuted on NBC with Peter Tomarken as its host. \"Hit Man\" lasted thirteen weeks on the air.\nWhen was Locke born?\nAdria Locke LangleyLocke was born in Iowa, 1899, as the youngest of three children. When she was young her family moved to Stanton, Nebraska and that is where she grew up. Her father William Locke, was president of the Omaha livestock market and a Quaker. He had certain ideas of what a woman should be. Because of this Adria's grandfather, Thomas Glendenning, took over in teaching her what would later be a great social consciousness.\nKeith LockeLocke was born and grew up in Christchurch, to Jack and Elsie Locke, prominent lifelong political activists for a wide variety of causes. Their four children were brought up in this environment and followed their parents into a life of activism, (as well as Keith, his sister Maire Leadbeater is a well-known activist and former city councillor for Auckland City Council). His father Jack was under surveillance during the 1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute.Former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon is said to have described the Lockes as the most \"notorious Communist family in New Zealand\". The Lockes lived in the Avon Loop area of the Christchurch Central City and were very active in the community notably organising Avon River clean-ups and native tree planting and arguing against development of the area, and in favour of retaining the character of the area.\nHow do plants get blight?\nBacterial blight of soybeanBacterial blight of soybeans can enter leaves through wounds or natural openings such as stomata. After gaining entrance to the host leaves, \"Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea\" multiplies in the leaf intercellular fluid. The pathogen must then overcome the plants defenses. \"Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea\" accomplishes this by using the type three secretion system to inject a variety of pathogenicity effector proteins (Hrp proteins) into the plant cell cytoplasm. These proteins act by interfering with effector-triggered immunity and producing phytohormones/toxins that suppress plant defenses. The expression of these virulence factors depends on the environmental conditions at the time of infection (see \"environment section). Furthermore, expression of virulence factors will only take place when a sufficiently large population of bacteria is present, which is determined through quorum sensing. When successful, the common symptoms of bacterial blight will be...\nGummy stem blightGummy Stem Blight is a cucurbit-rot disease caused by the fungal plant pathogen \"Didymella bryoniae\" (anamorph \"Phoma cucurbitacearum\").Gummy Stem Blight can affect a host at any stage of growth in its development and affects all parts of the host including leaves, stems and fruits. Symptoms generally consist of circular dark tan lesions that blight the leaf, water soaked leaves, stem cankers, and gummy brown ooze that exudes from cankers, giving it the name Gummy Stem Blight. Gummy Stem Blight reduces yields of edible cucurbits by devastating the vines and leaves and rotting the fruits.\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\": [\n1024,\n512,\n256,\n128,\n64,\n32\n],\n\"matryoshka_weights\": [\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1,\n1\n],\n\"n_dims_per_step\": -1\n}\nmldr\nDataset: mldr at 40ad767\nSize: 200,000 evaluation samples\nColumns: anchor, positive, and negative\nApproximate statistics based on the first 1000 samples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative\ntype\nstring\nstring\nstring\ndetails\nmin: 16 charactersmean: 66.52 charactersmax: 527 characters\nmin: 3223 charactersmean: 20386.58 charactersmax: 131268 characters\nmin: 3611 charactersmean: 15772.93 charactersmax: 145135 characters\nSamples:\nanchor\npositive\nnegative\nWhat is an Aboriginal reserve and how was it created?\nAn Aboriginal reserve, also called simply reserve, was a government-sanctioned settlement for Aboriginal Australians, created under various state and federal legislation. Along with missions and other institutions, they were used from the 19th century to the 1960s to keep Aboriginal people separate from the white Australian population, for various reasons perceived by the government of the day. The Aboriginal reserve laws gave governments much power over all aspects of Aboriginal people’s lives.Protectors of Aborigines and (later) Aboriginal Protection Boards were appointed to look after the interests of the Aboriginal people.HistoryAboriginal reserves were used from the nineteenth century to keep Aboriginal people separate from the white Australian population, often ostensibly for their protection.Protectors of Aborigines had been appointed from as early as 1836 in South Australia (with Matthew Moorhouse as the first permanent appointment as Chief Protector in 1839), with the G...\nThe  Nature Reserve () is a nature reserve located in the municipalities of Sorsele and Storuman in Västerbotten County of Swedish Lapland. It is the largest natural reserve in Sweden and one of the largest protected areas in Europe, totaling 562,772 ha (approx. 5,628 km2).Most of the reserve is made up of several Scandinavian Mountains, the main ones being Artfjället, Norra Storfjället, Ammarfjället and Björkfjället. Most of the landscapes of the Swedish mountains are represented. This ranges from the pronounced alpine character of Norra Storfjället, which includes the highlight of the reserve, the Norra Sytertoppen (1,768 m), to the plateau and plains near the base of the mountains. The differences in elevation highlight the diversity of rocks in the mountains. Among the mountains are the valleys and waterways of the Ume River drainage basin. This includes a portion of the Vindel River, after which the reserve is named. Towards the east, the elevation decreases and the mountains gi...\nWhat is the English translation of the song \"Bosanac\"?\nThis is a list of Bosnian patriotic songs.{\nclass=\"wikitable sortable\"\nWho were the representatives that declined to run for reelection to the Vermont House of Representatives in 2016?\nSelene Colburn is an American politician currently serving in the Vermont House of Representatives from the Chittenden-6-4 district since 2017 as a member of the Vermont Progressive Party.

Sardinia's indigenous language and the other minority languages (Sassarese, Corsican Gallurese, Algherese Catalan and Ligurian Tabarchino) spoken on the island are recognized by the regional law and enjoy \"equal dignity\" with Italian.[5]\nHistory of CagliariCaralis (or Karales) was the capital of the Roman province of Sardinia and Corsica and was elevated to the rank of \"Municipium\", a result of the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey when Caesar himself granted this status in gratitude to the city for its fidelity during the bloody war. All Caralitani obtained Roman citizenship and were enrolled in the tribe Quirina. The territory of the city included the campidano plain, likely becoming Sanluri.With about 20,000 inhabitants Caralis was the largest and most populous city of the island and the most important of the western Mediterranean basin of the Republic, and later of the Roman Empire. The city was equipped with important road links to the main towns of the island such as Sulki, with the coastal road and with that running through the valley of the Cixerri, Olbia and Tibula along the east coast, and Turris and Tibula along the road modeled on the current \"Carlo Felice\", and finally a road through the centre ...\nWhat activism did Katherine Schmidt participate in?\nKatherine SchmidtKatherine Schmidt (February 6, 1899 – April 18, 1978) was an American artist and art activist. Early in her career the figure studies, landscapes, and still lifes she painted drew praise for their \"purity and clarity of color,\" \"sound draftsmanship,\" and \"individual choice of subject and its handling.\"[3] During the 1930s she was known mainly for the quality of her still life paintings which showed, one critic said, \"impeccable artistry.\"[4] At the end of her career, in the 1960s and 1970s, she produced specialized and highly disciplined still lifes of objects such as dead leaves and pieces of crumpled paper, which, said a critic, approached a \"magical realism.\"[5] As an art activist she helped promote the rights of artists for fair remuneration.[6]\nCaroline KatzensteinCaroline Katzenstein (1888–1968) was an American suffragist, activist, advocate for equal rights, insurance agent, and author. She was active in the local Philadelphia suffragist movement through the Pennsylvania branch of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the Equal Franchise Society of Philadelphia. She played a role in the formation of the Congressional Union for Women Suffrage, which later became the National Women's Party. Katzenstein was also active in the movement for equal rights, serving on the Women's Joint Legislative Committee with Alice Paul, and championing the cause for the Equal Rights Amendment. She was the author of \"Lifting the Curtain: the State and National Woman Suffrage Campaigns in Pennsylvania as I Saw Them\" (1955).\nWho made the first wristwatch?\nHistory of watchesFrom the beginning, wristwatches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocketwatches up until the early 20th century. The concept of the wristwatch goes back to the production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. Some people say the world's first wristwatch was created by Abraham-Louis Breguet for Caroline Murat, Queen of Naples, in 1810.[21][22][23][24][25] Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch from Robert Dudley in 1571, described as an arm watch. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as bracelets, for women.[26]\nRolexIn 1908, Wilsdorf registered the trademark \"Rolex\" and opened an office in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland.[14][15] The book The Best of Time: Rolex Wristwatches: An Unauthorized History by Jeffrey P. Hess and James Dowling says that the name was just made up.[16] One story, never confirmed by Wilsdorf, recounts that the name came from the French phrase horlogerie exquise, meaning \"exquisite clockwork\"[9] or as a contraction of \"horological excellence\". Wilsdorf was said to want his watch brand's name to be easily pronounceable in any language.[17] He also thought that the name \"Rolex\" was onomatopoeic, sounding like a watch being wound. It is easily pronounceable in many languages and, as all its upper-case letters have the same size, can be written symmetrically. It was also short enough to fit on the face of a watch.[17]\nLoss: MatryoshkaLoss with these parameters:{\n\"loss\": \"MultipleNegativesRankingLoss\",\n\"matryoshka_dims\":

It was used to generate synthetic transcriptions for training Parakeet. Diarization is performed implicitly by the model, where \"[S1]\", \"[S2]\", etc. denote speaker identity.

As a child, Gellar modeled for Wilhelmina and appeared in commercials for Burger King, Avon, and Shake ’n Bake. She featured in the fast food industry’s very first “attack ad,” in which she negatively compared McDonald's' food to that of Burger King. The former was outraged by the commercial and sued Burger King, naming the 5-year-old Gellar as a defendant. She reportedly received a lifetime ban from McDonald's that forbade her from eating at any of their restaurants. In 1983, Gellar made her screen acting debut in the television film \"An Invasion of Privacy,\" after impressing the casting director by reading both her own and co-star Valerie Bertolini's lines in her audition. After a stint on the short-lived teen drama series “Swans Crossing\" playing mean girl Sydney Rutledge, she was cast as a similar character, Kendall Hart, on the soap “All My Children,” for which she received a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress. From 1997-2003, Gellar headlined the supernatural drama “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” a hugely popular and influential series that launched her to stardom and brought her widespread acclaim and recognition, including a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama, a Saturn Award for Best Genre TV Actress, and a SFX Award for Best TV Actress, among many others. Gellar has also achieved significant success in film, having starred in box office hits like “I Know What You Did Last Summer” (1997), “Scream 2” (1997), “Cruel Intentions” (1999), “Scooby-Doo” (2002) and “Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed” (2004), “The Grudge” (2004) and “The Grudge 2” (2006), and “TMNT” (2007), as well as independent films such as “Southland Tales” (2006), “The Air I Breathe” (2007), and “Veronika Decides to Die” (2009). Her small role in the 2022 film “Do Revenge” was written specifically for her, envisioned as an adult version of her character in “Cruel Intentions.” Gellar's other notable credits include the television series “Ringer, “The Crazy Ones,” and “Wolf Pack,” all of which were canceled after just one season, and the upcoming “Dexter: Original Sin.\" Because of her involvement in so many horror-adjacent projects, Gellar has been dubbed the scream queen of her generation. In 2015, Gellar co-founded Foodstirs, an e-commerce startup selling organic baking kits, and later released her own cookbook, “Stirring Up Fun with Food.” Gellar has been married to her “I Know What You Did Last Summer” and “Scooby-Doo” co-star Freddie Prinze, Jr. since 2002.\nTrigger words\nYou should use smg to trigger the image generation.\nDownload model\nWeights for this model are available in Safetensors format.\nDownload them in the Files & versions tab.\nUse it with the 🧨 diffusers library\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image\nimport torch\ndevice = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\npipeline = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from_pretrained('black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev', torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to(device)\npipeline.load_lora_weights('Keltezaa/sarah-michelle-gellar-flux-model', weight_name='SMGFluxModel.safetensors')\nimage = pipeline('`smg`').images[0]\nFor more details, including weighting, merging and fusing LoRAs, check the documentation on loading LoRAs in diffusers",

Check out Q4_0_4_4 speed comparisons on the original pull request\nTo check which one would work best for your ARM chip, you can check AArch64 SoC features (thanks EloyOn!).\nWhich file should I choose?\nA great write up with charts showing various performances is provided by Artefact2 here\nThe first thing to figure out is how big a model you can run. To do this, you'll need to figure out how much RAM and/or VRAM you have.\nIf you want your model running as FAST as possible, you'll want to fit the whole thing on your GPU's VRAM. Aim for a quant with a file size 1-2GB smaller than your GPU's total VRAM.\nIf you want the absolute maximum quality, add both your system RAM and your GPU's VRAM together, then similarly grab a quant with a file size 1-2GB Smaller than that total.\nNext, you'll need to decide if you want to use an 'I-quant' or a 'K-quant'.\nIf you don't want to think too much, grab one of the K-quants. These are in format 'QX_K_X', like Q5_K_M.\nIf you want to get more into the weeds, you can check out this extremely useful feature chart:\nllama.cpp feature matrix\nBut basically, if you're aiming for below Q4, and you're running cuBLAS (Nvidia) or rocBLAS (AMD), you should look towards the I-quants. These are in format IQX_X, like IQ3_M. These are newer and offer better performance for their size.\nThese I-quants can also be used on CPU and Apple Metal, but will be slower than their K-quant equivalent, so speed vs performance is a tradeoff you'll have to decide.\nThe I-quants are not compatible with Vulcan, which is also AMD, so if you have an AMD card double check if you're using the rocBLAS build or the Vulcan build. At the time of writing this, LM Studio has a preview with ROCm support, and other inference engines have specific builds for ROCm.\nCredits\nThank you kalomaze and Dampf for assistance in creating the imatrix calibration dataset\nThank you ZeroWw for the inspiration to experiment with embed/output\nWant to support my work?

The 21 languages supported are: Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, English, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu.\nThanks to its better prompt tokenizer, it can easily be extended to other languages. This tokenizer has a larger vocabulary and handles byte fallback, which simplifies multilingual training.\n🚨 This work is the result of a collaboration between the HuggingFace audio team and the AI4Bharat team. 🚨\n📖 Quick Index\n👨‍💻 Installation\n🛠️ Key capabilities\n🎲 Using a random voice\n🌍 Switching languages\n🎯 Using a specific speaker\nSome Description Examples\n📐Evaluation\nMotivation\nOptimizing inference\n👨‍💻 Installation\nUsing Parler-TTS is as simple as \"bonjour\". Simply install the library once:\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/parler-tts.git\n🛠️ Key capabilities\nThe model accepts two primary inputs:\nTranscript - The text to be converted to speech.\nCaption - A detailed description of how the speech should sound, e.g., \"Leela speaks in a high-pitched, fast-paced, and cheerful tone, full of energy and happiness. The recording is very high quality with no background noise.\"\nKey Features\nLanguage Support\nOfficially supported languages: Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Sanskrit, Nepali, English, Telugu, Hindi, Gujarati, Konkani, Maithili, Manipuri, Odia, Santali, Sindhi, Tamil, and Urdu.\nUnofficial support: Chhattisgarhi, Kashmiri, Punjabi.\nSpeaker Diversity\n69 unique voices across the supported languages.\nSupported languages have a set of recommended voices optimized for naturalness and intelligibility.\nEmotion Rendering\n10 languages officially support emotion-specific prompts: Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Sanskrit, Nepali, and Tamil.\nEmotion support for other languages exists but has not been extensively tested.\nAvailable emotions include: Command, Anger, Narration, Conversation, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Proper Noun, News, Sad, and Surprise.\nAccent Flexibility\nThe model officially supports Indian English accents through its English voices, providing clear and natural speech.\nFor other accents, the model allows customization by specifying accent details, such as \"A male British speaker\" or \"A female American speaker,\" using style transfer for more dynamic and personalized outputs.\nCustomizable OutputIndic Parler-TTS offers precise control over various speech characteristics using the caption input:\nBackground Noise: Adjust the noise level in the audio, from clear to slightly noisy environments.\nReverberation: Control the perceived distance of the voice, from close-sounding to distant-sounding speech.\nExpressivity: Specify how dynamic or monotone the speech should be, ranging from expressive to slightly expressive or monotone.\nPitch: Modify the pitch of the speech, including high, low, or balanced tones.\nSpeaking Rate: Change the speaking rate, from slow to fast.\nVoice Quality: Control the overall clarity and naturalness of the speech, adjusting from basic to refined voice quality.\n🎲 Random voice\n🚨 Unlike previous versions of Parler-TTS, here we use two tokenizers - one for the prompt and one for the description. 🚨\nIndic Parler-TTS has been trained to generate speech with features that can be controlled with a simple text prompt, for example:\nimport torch\nfrom parler_tts import ParlerTTSForConditionalGeneration\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\nimport soundfile as sf\ndevice = \"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\nmodel = ParlerTTSForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"ai4bharat/indic-parler-tts\").to(device)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"ai4bharat/indic-parler-tts\")\ndescription_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model.config.text_encoder._name_or_path)\nprompt = \"Hey, how are you doing today?\"\ndescription = \"A female speaker with a British accent delivers a slightly expressive and animated speech with a moderate speed and pitch. The recording is of very high quality, with the speaker's voice sounding clear and very close up.\"\ndescription_input_ids = description_tokenizer(description, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)\nprompt_input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)\ngeneration = model.generate(input_ids=description_input_ids.input_ids, attention_mask=description_input_ids.attention_mask, prompt_input_ids=prompt_input_ids.input_ids, prompt_attention_mask=prompt_input_ids.attention_mask)\naudio_arr = generation.cpu().numpy().squeeze()\nsf.write(\"indic_tts_out.wav\", audio_arr, model.config.sampling_rate)\nIndic Parler-TTS provides highly effective control over key aspects of speech synthesis using descriptive captions. Below is a summary of what each control parameter can achieve:\nControl Type\nCapabilities\nBackground Noise\nAdjusts the level of background noise, supporting clear and slightly noisy environments.\nReverberation\nControls the perceived distance of the speaker’s voice, allowing close or distant sounds.\nExpressivity\nModulates the emotional intensity of speech, from monotone to highly expressive.\nPitch\nVaries the pitch to achieve high, low, or moderate tonal output.\nSpeaking Rate\nChanges the speed of speech delivery, ranging from slow to fast-paced.\nSpeech Quality\nImproves or degrades the overall audio clarity, supporting basic to refined outputs.\n🌍 Switching languages\nThe model automatically adapts to the language it detects in the prompt. You don't need to specify the language you want to use. For example, to switch to Hindi, simply use an Hindi prompt:\nimport torch\nfrom parler_tts import ParlerTTSForConditionalGeneration\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\nimport soundfile as sf\ndevice = \"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\nmodel = ParlerTTSForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"ai4bharat/indic-parler-tts\").to(device)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"ai4bharat/indic-parler-tts\")\ndescription_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model.config.text_encoder._name_or_path)\nprompt = \"अरे, तुम आज कैसे हो?\"\ndescription = \"A female speaker delivers a slightly expressive and animated speech with a moderate speed and pitch.

Think SDPA, torch.compile, batching and streaming!\nInclude the term \"very clear audio\" to generate the highest quality audio, and \"very noisy audio\" for high levels of background noise\nPunctuation can be used to control the prosody of the generations, e.g. use commas to add small breaks in speech\nThe remaining speech features (gender, speaking rate, pitch and reverberation) can be controlled directly through the prompt\nSome Description Examples\nAditi - Slightly High-Pitched, Expressive Tone:\"Aditi speaks with a slightly higher pitch in a close-sounding environment. Her voice is clear, with subtle emotional depth and a normal pace, all captured in high-quality recording.\"\nSita - Rapid, Slightly Monotone:\"Sita speaks at a fast pace with a slightly low-pitched voice, captured clearly in a close-sounding environment with excellent recording quality.\"\nTapan - Male, Moderate Pace, Slightly Monotone:\"Tapan speaks at a moderate pace with a slightly monotone tone. The recording is clear, with a close sound and only minimal ambient noise.\"\nSunita - High-Pitched, Happy Tone:\"Sunita speaks with a high pitch in a close environment. Her voice is clear, with slight dynamic changes, and the recording is of excellent quality.\"\nKaran - High-Pitched, Positive Tone:\"Karan’s high-pitched, engaging voice is captured in a clear, close-sounding recording. His slightly slower delivery conveys a positive tone.\"\nAmrita - High-Pitched, Flat Tone:\"Amrita speaks with a high pitch at a slow pace. Her voice is clear, with excellent recording quality and only moderate background noise.\"\nAditi - Slow, Slightly Expressive:\"Aditi speaks slowly with a high pitch and expressive tone. The recording is clear, showcasing her energetic and emotive voice.\"\nYoung Male Speaker, American Accent:\"A young male speaker with a high-pitched American accent delivers speech at a slightly fast pace in a clear, close-sounding recording.\"\nBikram - High-Pitched, Urgent Tone:\"Bikram speaks with a higher pitch and fast pace, conveying urgency. The recording is clear and intimate, with great emotional depth.\"\nAnjali - High-Pitched, Neutral Tone: \"Anjali speaks with a high pitch at a normal pace in a clear, close-sounding environment. Her neutral tone is captured with excellent audio quality.\"\n📐 Evaluation\nIndic Parler-TTS has been evaluated using a MOS-like framework by native and non-native speakers.
