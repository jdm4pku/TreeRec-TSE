Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\nLicense A custom commercial license, the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement, is available at: https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama3_3/LICENSE\nWhere to send questions or comments about the model Instructions on how to provide feedback or comments on the model can be found in the model README. For more technical information about generation parameters and recipes for how to use Llama 3.3 in applications, please go here.\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases Llama 3.3 is intended for commercial and research use in multiple languages. Instruction tuned text only models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks. The Llama 3.3 model also supports the ability to leverage the outputs of its models to improve other models including synthetic data generation and distillation. The Llama 3.3 Community License allows for these use cases.\nOut-of-scope Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3.3 Community License. Use in languages beyond those explicitly referenced as supported in this model card**.\n**Note: Llama 3.3 has been trained on a broader collection of languages than the 8 supported languages. Developers may fine-tune Llama 3.3 models for languages beyond the 8 supported languages provided they comply with the Llama 3.3 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy and in such cases are responsible for ensuring that any uses of Llama 3.3 in additional languages is done in a safe and responsible manner.\nHow to use\nThis repository contains two versions of Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, for use with transformers and with the original llama codebase.\nUse with transformers\nStarting with transformers >= 4.43.0 onward, you can run conversational inference using the Transformers pipeline abstraction or by leveraging the Auto classes with the generate() function.\nMake sure to update your transformers installation via pip install --upgrade transformers.\nSee the snippet below for usage with Transformers:\nimport transformers\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\"\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n\"text-generation\",\nmodel=model_id,\nmodel_kwargs={\"torch_dtype\": torch.bfloat16},\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\n)\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak!\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who are you?\"},\n]\noutputs = pipeline(\nmessages,\nmax_new_tokens=256,\n)\nprint(outputs[0][\"generated_text\"][-1])\nTool use with transformers\nLLaMA-3.3 supports multiple tool use formats. You can see a full guide to prompt formatting here.\nTool use is also supported through chat templates in Transformers.\nHere is a quick example showing a single simple tool:\n# First, define a tool\ndef get_current_temperature(location: str) -> float:\n\"\"\"\nGet the current temperature at a location.\nArgs:\nlocation: The location to get the temperature for, in the format \"City, Country\"\nReturns:\nThe current temperature at the specified location in the specified units, as a float.\n\"\"\"\nreturn 22.  # A real function should probably actually get the temperature!\n# Next, create a chat and apply the chat template\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a bot that responds to weather queries.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hey, what's the temperature in Paris right now?\"}\n]\ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tools=[get_current_temperature], add_generation_prompt=True)\nYou can then generate text from this input as normal. If the model generates a tool call, you should add it to the chat like so:\ntool_call = {\"name\": \"get_current_temperature\", \"arguments\": {\"location\": \"Paris, France\"}}\nmessages.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"tool_calls\": [{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": tool_call}]})\nand then call the tool and append the result, with the tool role, like so:\nmessages.append({\"role\": \"tool\", \"name\": \"get_current_temperature\", \"content\": \"22.0\"})\nAfter that, you can generate() again to let the model use the tool result in the chat. Note that this was a very brief introduction to tool calling - for more information,\nsee the LLaMA prompt format docs and the Transformers tool use documentation.\nUse with bitsandbytes\nThe model checkpoints can be used in 8-bit and 4-bit for further memory optimisations using bitsandbytes and transformers\nSee the snippet below for usage:\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\"\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)\nquantized_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id, device_map=\"auto\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, quantization_config=quantization_config)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\ninput_text = \"What are we having for dinner?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\noutput = quantized_model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=10)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\nTo load in 4-bit simply pass load_in_4bit=True\nUse with llama\nPlease, follow the instructions in the repository.\nTo download Original checkpoints, see the example command below leveraging huggingface-cli:\nhuggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct --include \"original/*\" --local-dir Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's custom built GPU cluster, and production infrastructure for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on production infrastructure.\nTraining Energy Use Training utilized a cumulative of 39.3M GPU hours of computation on H100-80GB (TDP of 700W) type hardware, per the table below. Training time is the total GPU time required for training each model and power consumption is the peak power capacity per GPU device used, adjusted for power usage efficiency.\nTraining Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimated total location-based greenhouse gas emissions were 11,390 tons CO2eq for training. Since 2020, Meta has maintained net zero greenhouse gas emissions in its global operations and matched 100% of its electricity use with renewable energy, therefore the total market-based greenhouse gas emissions for training were 0 tons CO2eq.\nTraining Time (GPU hours)\nTraining Power Consumption (W)\nTraining Location-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tons CO2eq)\nTraining Market-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions (tons CO2eq)\nLlama 3.3 70B\n7.0M\n700\n2,040\n0\nThe methodology used to determine training energy use and greenhouse gas emissions can be found here.  Since Meta is openly releasing these models, the training energy use and greenhouse gas emissions  will not be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview: Llama 3.3 was pretrained on ~15 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over 25M synthetically generated examples.\nData Freshness: The pretraining data has a cutoff of December 2023.\nBenchmarks - English Text\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 3.3 relative to our previous models.\nInstruction tuned models\nCategory\nBenchmark\n# Shots\nMetric\nLlama 3.1 8B Instruct\nLlama 3.1 70B Instruct\nLlama-3.3 70B Instruct\nLlama 3.1 405B Instruct\nMMLU (CoT)\n0\nmacro_avg/acc\n73.0\n86.0\n86.0\n88.6\nMMLU Pro (CoT)\n5\nmacro_avg/acc\n48.3\n66.4\n68.9\n73.3\nSteerability\nIFEval\n80.4\n87.5\n92.1\n88.6\nReasoning\nGPQA Diamond (CoT)\n0\nacc\n31.8\n48.0\n50.5\n49.0\nCode\nHumanEval\n0\npass@1\n72.6\n80.5\n88.4\n89.0\nMBPP EvalPlus (base)\n0\npass@1\n72.8\n86.0\n87.6\n88.6\nMath\nMATH (CoT)\n0\nsympy_intersection_score\n51.9\n68.0\n77.0\n73.8\nTool Use\nBFCL v2\n0\noverall_ast_summary/macro_avg/valid\n65.4\n77.5\n77.3\n81.1\nMultilingual\nMGSM\n0\nem\n68.9\n86.9\n91.1\n91.6\nResponsibility & Safety\nAs part of our Responsible release approach, we followed a three-pronged strategy to managing trust & safety risks:\nEnable developers to deploy helpful, safe and flexible experiences for their target audience and for the use cases supported by Llama.\nProtect developers against adversarial users aiming to exploit Llama capabilities to potentially cause harm.\nProvide protections for the community to help prevent the misuse of our models.\nResponsible deployment\nLlama is a foundational technology designed to be used in a variety of use cases, examples on how Meta’s Llama models have been responsibly deployed can be found in our Community Stories webpage. Our approach is to build the most helpful models enabling the world to benefit from the technology power, by aligning our model safety for the generic use cases addressing a standard set of harms. Developers are then in the driver seat to tailor safety for their use case, defining their own policy and deploying the models with the necessary safeguards in their Llama systems. Llama 3.3 was developed following the best practices outlined in our Responsible Use Guide, you can refer to the Responsible Use Guide to learn more.\nLlama 3.3 instruct\nOur main objectives for conducting safety fine-tuning are to provide the research community with a valuable resource for studying the robustness of safety fine-tuning, as well as to offer developers a readily available, safe, and powerful model for various applications to reduce the developer workload to deploy safe AI systems. For more details on the safety mitigations implemented please read the Llama 3 paper.\nFine-tuning dataWe employ a multi-faceted approach to data collection, combining human-generated data from our vendors with synthetic data to mitigate potential safety risks. We’ve developed many large language model (LLM)-based classifiers that enable us to thoughtfully select high-quality prompts and responses, enhancing data quality control.\nRefusals and ToneBuilding on the work we started with Llama 3, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts as well as refusal tone. We included both borderline and adversarial prompts in our safety data strategy, and modified our safety data responses to follow  tone guidelines.\nLlama 3.3 systems\nLarge language models, including Llama 3.3, are not designed to be deployed in isolation but instead should be deployed as part of an overall AI system with additional safety guardrails as required. Developers are expected to deploy system safeguards when building agentic systems. Safeguards are key to achieve the right helpfulness-safety alignment as well as mitigating safety and security risks inherent to the system and any integration of the model or system with external tools.As part of our responsible release approach, we provide the community with safeguards that developers should deploy with Llama models or other LLMs, including Llama Guard 3, Prompt Guard and Code Shield. All our reference implementations demos contain these safeguards by default so developers can benefit from system-level safety out-of-the-box.\nNew capabilities\nNote that this release introduces new capabilities, including a longer context window, multilingual inputs and outputs and possible integrations by developers with third party tools. Building with these new capabilities requires specific considerations in addition to the best practices that generally apply across all Generative AI use cases.\nTool-use: Just like in standard software development, developers are responsible for the integration of the LLM with the tools and services of their choice. They should define a clear policy for their use case and assess the integrity of the third party services they use to be aware of the safety and security limitations when using this capability. Refer to the Responsible Use Guide for best practices on the safe deployment of the third party safeguards.\nMultilinguality: Llama 3.3 supports 7 languages in addition to English: French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai. Llama may be able to output text in other languages than those that meet performance thresholds for safety and helpfulness. We strongly discourage developers from using this model to converse in non-supported languages without implementing finetuning and system controls in alignment with their policies and the best practices shared in the Responsible Use Guide.\nEvaluations\nWe evaluated Llama models for common use cases as well as specific capabilities. Common use cases evaluations measure safety risks of systems for most commonly built applications including chat bot, coding assistant, tool calls. We built dedicated, adversarial evaluation datasets and evaluated systems composed of Llama models and Llama Guard 3 to filter input prompt and output response. It is important to evaluate applications in context, and we recommend building dedicated evaluation dataset for your use case. Prompt Guard and Code Shield are also available if relevant to the application.Capability evaluations measure vulnerabilities of Llama models inherent to specific capabilities, for which were crafted dedicated benchmarks including long context, multilingual, tools calls, coding or memorization.\nRed teamingFor both scenarios, we conducted recurring red teaming exercises with the goal of discovering risks via adversarial prompting and we used the learnings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets.We partnered early with subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to understand the nature of these real-world harms and how such models may lead to unintended harm for society. Based on these conversations, we derived a set of adversarial goals for the red team to attempt to achieve, such as extracting harmful information or reprogramming the model to act in a potentially harmful capacity.  The red team consisted of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, responsible AI, and integrity in addition to multilingual content specialists with background in integrity issues in specific geographic markets. .\nCritical and other risks\nWe specifically focused our efforts on mitigating the following critical risk areas:\n1- CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive materials) helpfulnessTo assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, we performed uplift testing designed to assess whether use of the Llama 3.3 model could meaningfully increase the capabilities of malicious actors to plan or carry out attacks using these types of weapons.\n2. Child Safety\nChild Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development.  For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors including the additional languages Llama 3 is trained on. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\n3. Cyber attack enablementOur cyber attack uplift study investigated whether LLMs can enhance human capabilities in hacking tasks, both in terms of skill level and speed.Our attack automation study focused on evaluating the capabilities of LLMs when used as autonomous agents in cyber offensive operations, specifically in the context of ransomware attacks. This evaluation was distinct from previous studies that considered LLMs as interactive assistants. The primary objective was to assess whether these models could effectively function as independent agents in executing complex cyber-attacks without human intervention.\nCommunity\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership on AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nWe also set up the Llama Impact Grants program to identify and support the most compelling applications of Meta’s Llama model for societal benefit across three categories: education, climate and open innovation. The 20 finalists from the hundreds of applications can be found here.\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nThe core values of Llama 3.3 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3.3 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nBut Llama 3.3 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3.3’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3.3 model, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.

Это помогает модели лучше понять контекст и цель запроса, что положительно сказывается на качестве результатов. Важно отметить, что инструкцию нужно добавлять только перед запросом, а не перед документом.\nДля симметричных задач, таких как классификация (classification) или семантическое сравнение текстов (semantic text similarity), инструкцию необходимо добавлять перед каждым запросом. Это связано с тем, что такие задачи требуют одинакового контекста для всех входных данных, чтобы модель могла корректно сравнивать или классифицировать их.\nПримеры инструкций для симметричных задач:\n\"Retrieve semantically similar text\"\n\"Given a text, retrieve semantically similar text\"\n\"Дано предложение, необходимо найти его парафраз\"\n\"Классифицируй отзыв на товар как положительный, отрицательный или нейтральный\"\n\"Классифицируй чувствительную тему по запросу\"\nДля retrieval-задач (например, поиск ответа в тексте) можно использовать инструкцию:'Дан вопрос, необходимо найти абзац текста с ответом'.\nТакой подход особенно эффективен для задач поиска и извлечения информации, таких как поиск релевантных документов или извлечение ответов из текста.\nПримеры инструкций для retrieval-задач:\n'Дан вопрос, необходимо найти абзац текста с ответом'\n'Given the question, find a paragraph with the answer'\nИнструкции необходимо оборачивать в шаблон: f'Instruct: {task_description}\\nQuery: {query}'. Использование инструкций позволяет значительно улучшить качество поиска и релевантность результатов, что подтверждается тестами на бенчмарках, таких как RuBQ, MIRACL. Для симметричных задач добавление инструкции перед каждым запросом обеспечивает согласованность и повышает точность модели.\nПоддерживаемые языки\nЭта модель инициализирована pretrain моделью GigaChat и дополнительно обучена на смеси английских и русских данных.\nFAQ\nНужно ли добавлять инструкции к запросу?\nДа, именно так модель обучалась, иначе вы увидите снижение качества. Определение задачи должно быть инструкцией в одном предложении, которая описывает задачу. Это способ настройки текстовых эмбеддингов для разных сценариев с помощью инструкций на естественном языке.\nС другой стороны, добавлять инструкции на сторону документа не требуется.\nПочему мои воспроизведённые результаты немного отличаются от указанных в карточке модели?\nРазные версии библиотек transformers и pytorch могут вызывать незначительные, но ненулевые различия в результатах.\nОграничения\nИспользование этой модели для входных данных, содержащих более 4096 токенов, невозможно.",

앞서 살펴본 바와 같이 우리 헌법과 ｢법원조직 법｣은 대법원 구성을 다양화하여 기본권 보장과 민주주의 확립에 있어 다각적인 법적 모색을 가능하게 하는 것을 근본 규범으로 하고 있다. 더욱이 합의체로서의 대법원 원리를 채택하고 있는 것 역시 그 구성의 다양성을 요청하는 것으로 해석된다. 이와 같은 관점에서 볼 때 현직 법원장급 고위법관을 중심으로 대법원을 구성하는 관행은 개선할 필요가 있는 것으로 보인다.',\n'연방헌법재판소는 2001년 1월 24일 5:3의 다수견해로 「법원조직법」 제169조 제2문이 헌법에 합치된다는 판결을 내렸음 ○ 5인의 다수 재판관은 소송관계인의 인격권 보호, 공정한 절차의 보장과 방해받지 않는 법과 진실 발견 등을 근거로 하여 텔레비전 촬영에 대한 절대적인 금지를 헌법에 합치하는 것으로 보았음 ○ 그러나 나머지 3인의 재판관은 행정법원의 소송절차는 특별한 인격권 보호의 이익도 없으며, 텔레비전 공개주의로 인해 법과 진실 발견의 과정이 언제나 위태롭게 되는 것은 아니라면서 반대의견을 제시함 ○ 왜냐하면 행정법원의 소송절차에서는 소송당사자가 개인적으로 직접 심리에 참석하기보다는 변호사가 참석하는 경우가 많으며, 심리대상도 사실문제가 아닌 법률문제가 대부분이기 때문이라는 것임 □ 한편, 연방헌법재판소는 「연방헌법재판소법」(Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz: BVerfGG) 제17a조에 따라 제한적이나마 재판에 대한 방송을 허용하고 있음 ○ 「연방헌법재판소법」 제17조에서 「법원조직법」 제14절 내지 제16절의 규정을 준용하도록 하고 있지만, 녹음이나 촬영을 통한

We have already released three LoRA models,\nfocusing on portraits, objects, and regional editing, with the expectation that each would demonstrate strong adaptability\nwithin their respective domains. Undoubtedly, this presents certain challenges.\nWe are currently training a fully fine-tuned model, which has now entered the final stage of quality tuning.\nWe are confident it will be released soon. This model will support a broader range of capabilities and is\nexpected to empower community developers to build even more interesting applications.\n📢 News\n[2025.01.06] Release the code and models of ACE++.\n[2025.01.07] Release the demo on HuggingFace.\n[2025.01.16] Release the training code for lora.\n[2025.02.15] Collection of workflows in Comfyui.\n[2025.02.15] Release the config for fully fine-tuning.\n[2025.03.03] Release a unified fft model for ACE++, support more image to image tasks.\n🔥The unified fft model for ACE++\nFully finetuning a composite model with ACE’s data to support various editing and reference generation tasks through an instructive approach.\nWe found that there are conflicts between the repainting task and the editing task during the experimental process. This is because the edited image is concatenated with noise in the channel dimension, whereas the repainting task modifies the region using zero pixel values in the VAE's latent space. The editing task uses RGB pixel values in the modified region through the VAE's latent space, which is similar to the distribution of the non-modified part of the repainting task, making it a challenge for the model to distinguish between the two tasks.\nTo address this issue, we introduced 64 additional channels in the channel dimension to differentiate between these two tasks. In these channels, we place the latent representation of the pixel space from the edited image, while keeping other channels consistent with the repainting task. This approach significantly enhances the model's adaptability to different tasks.\nOne issue with this approach is that it changes the input channel number of the FLUX-Fill-Dev model from 384 to 448. The specific configuration can be referenced in the configuration file.\nExamples\nInput Reference Image\nInput Edit Image\nInput Edit Mask\nOutput\nInstruction\nFunction\n\"Maintain the facial features, A girl is wearing a neat police uniform and sporting a badge.

The tiger, which appears to be quite young, has distinctive orange, black, and white striped fur, typical of tigers. The cub's eyes have a bright and curious expression, and its ears are perked up, indicating alertness. The cub seems to be in the act of climbing or resting on the rock. The background is a blurred grassland with trees, but the focus is on the cub, which is vividly colored while the rest of the image is in grayscale, drawing attention to the tiger's details. The photo captures a moment in the wild, depicting the charming and tenacious nature of this young tiger, as well as its typical interaction with the environment.\"\n\"Super-resolution\"\n\"a blue hand\"\n\"Regional Editing\"\n\"Mechanical  hands like a robot\"\n\"Regional Editing\"\n\"{image} Beautiful female portrait, Robot with smooth White transparent carbon shell, rococo detailing, Natural lighting, Highly detailed, Cinematic, 4K.\"\n\"Recolorizing\"\n\"{image} Beautiful female portrait, Robot with smooth White transparent carbon shell, rococo detailing, Natural lighting, Highly detailed, Cinematic, 4K.\"\n\"Depth Guided Generation\"\n\"{image} Beautiful female portrait, Robot with smooth White transparent carbon shell, rococo detailing, Natural lighting, Highly detailed, Cinematic, 4K.\"\n\"Contour Guided Generation\"\nComfyui Workflows in community\nWe are deeply grateful to the community developers for building many fascinating applications based on the ACE++ series of models.\nDuring this process, we have received valuable feedback, particularly regarding artifacts in generated images and the stability of the results.\nIn response to these issues, many developers have proposed creative solutions, which have greatly inspired us, and we pay tribute to them.\nAt the same time, we will take these concerns into account in our further optimization efforts, carefully evaluating and testing before releasing new models.\nIn the table below, we have briefly listed some workflows for everyone to use.\nWorkflow\nAuthor\nExample\n【飞翔鲸】王炸！FLUX+ACE++换头\n飞翔鲸\n最新ACE++ Redux 万物迁移 AI模特换装 UP 楚门的AI世界\n楚门的AI世界\nAce Plus+Fill+Redux稳定无抽卡换装工作流\nT8star-Aix\nAce Plus+Fill+Redux稳定少抽卡标志工作流\nT8star-Aix\nAce Plus+Fill+Redux稳定无抽卡换脸工作流\nT8star-Aix\nace++ face swap in different styles\njax\nfllux ace++ subject without reference image\nleeguandong\nScepter-ACE++ More convenient replacement of everything\nHaoBeen\nAdditionally, many bloggers have published tutorials on how to use it, which are listed in the table below.\nTutorial\nBest Faceswapper I've Seen.

It obtains 81.1 AP on MS COCO Keypoint test-dev set.\nModel Details\nAlthough no specific domain knowledge is considered in the design, plain vision transformers have shown excellent performance in visual recognition tasks. However, little effort has been made to reveal the potential of such simple structures for\npose estimation tasks. In this paper, we show the surprisingly good capabilities of plain vision transformers for pose estimation from various aspects, namely simplicity in model structure, scalability in model size, flexibility in training paradigm,\nand transferability of knowledge between models, through a simple baseline model called ViTPose. Specifically, ViTPose employs plain and non-hierarchical vision\ntransformers as backbones to extract features for a given person instance and a\nlightweight decoder for pose estimation. It can be scaled up from 100M to 1B\nparameters by taking the advantages of the scalable model capacity and high\nparallelism of transformers, setting a new Pareto front between throughput and performance. Besides, ViTPose is very flexible regarding the attention type, input resolution, pre-training and finetuning strategy, as well as dealing with multiple pose\ntasks. We also empirically demonstrate that the knowledge of large ViTPose models\ncan be easily transferred to small ones via a simple knowledge token. Experimental\nresults show that our basic ViTPose model outperforms representative methods\non the challenging MS COCO Keypoint Detection benchmark, while the largest\nmodel sets a new state-of-the-art, i.e., 80.9 AP on the MS COCO test-dev set.

This model card has been automatically generated.\nDeveloped by: Yufei Xu, Jing Zhang, Qiming Zhang, Dacheng Tao\nFunded by: ARC FL-170100117 and IH-180100002.\nLicense: Apache-2.0\nPorted to 🤗 Transformers by: Sangbum Choi and Niels Rogge\nModel Sources\nOriginal repository: https://github.com/ViTAE-Transformer/ViTPose\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12484\nDemo: https://huggingface.co/spaces?sort=trending&search=vitpose\nUses\nThe ViTPose model, developed by the ViTAE-Transformer team, is primarily designed for pose estimation tasks. Here are some direct uses of the model:\nHuman Pose Estimation: The model can be used to estimate the poses of humans in images or videos. This involves identifying the locations of key body joints such as the head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.\nAction Recognition: By analyzing the poses over time, the model can help in recognizing various human actions and activities.\nSurveillance: In security and surveillance applications, ViTPose can be used to monitor and analyze human behavior in public spaces or private premises.\nHealth and Fitness: The model can be utilized in fitness apps to track and analyze exercise poses, providing feedback on form and technique.\nGaming and Animation: ViTPose can be integrated into gaming and animation systems to create more realistic character movements and interactions.\nBias, Risks, and Limitations\nIn this paper, we propose a simple yet effective vision transformer baseline for pose estimation,\ni.e., ViTPose. Despite no elaborate designs in structure, ViTPose obtains SOTA performance\non the MS COCO dataset. However, the potential of ViTPose is not fully explored with more\nadvanced technologies, such as complex decoders or FPN structures, which may further improve the\nperformance. Besides, although the ViTPose demonstrates exciting properties such as simplicity,\nscalability, flexibility, and transferability, more research efforts could be made, e.g., exploring the\nprompt-based tuning to demonstrate the flexibility of ViTPose further. In addition, we believe\nViTPose can also be applied to other pose estimation datasets, e.g., animal pose estimation [47, 9, 45]\nand face keypoint detection [21, 6]. We leave them as the future work.\nHow to Get Started with the Model\nUse the code below to get started with the model.\nimport torch\nimport requests\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import (\nAutoProcessor,\nRTDetrForObjectDetection,\nVitPoseForPoseEstimation,\n)\ndevice = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000000139.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Stage 1.

OCHuman [54] dataset is only involved in the evaluation stage to measure\nthe models’ performance in dealing with occluded people. The MS COCO dataset contains 118K\nimages and 150K human instances with at most 17 keypoint annotations each instance for training.\nThe dataset is under the CC-BY-4.0 license. MPII dataset is under the BSD license and contains\n15K images and 22K human instances for training. There are at most 16 human keypoints for each\ninstance annotated in this dataset. AI Challenger is much bigger and contains over 200K training\nimages and 350 human instances, with at most 14 keypoints for each instance annotated. OCHuman\ncontains human instances with heavy occlusion and is just used for val and test set, which includes\n4K images and 8K instances.\nTraining Hyperparameters\nTraining regime:\nSpeeds, Sizes, Times\nEvaluation\nOCHuman val and test set. To evaluate the performance of human pose estimation models on the\nhuman instances with heavy occlusion, we test the ViTPose variants and representative models on\nthe OCHuman val and test set with ground truth bounding boxes. We do not adopt extra human\ndetectors since not all human instances are annotated in the OCHuman datasets, where the human\ndetector will cause a lot of “false positive” bounding boxes and can not reflect the true ability of\npose estimation models. Specifically, the decoder head of ViTPose corresponding to the MS COCO\ndataset is used, as the keypoint definitions are the same in MS COCO and OCHuman datasets.\nMPII val set. We evaluate the performance of ViTPose and representative models on the MPII val\nset with the ground truth bounding boxes. Following the default settings of MPII, we use PCKh\nas metric for performance evaluation.\nResults\nModel Architecture and Objective\nHardware\nThe models are trained on 8 A100 GPUs based on the mmpose codebase\nCitation\nBibTeX:\n@article{xu2022vitposesimplevisiontransformer,\ntitle={ViTPose: Simple Vision Transformer Baselines for Human Pose Estimation},\nauthor={Yufei Xu and Jing Zhang and Qiming Zhang and Dacheng Tao},\nyear={2022},\neprint={2204.12484},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.CV},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12484}\n}",

This move is part of a broader strategy to declare a national emergency at the southern border to halt illegal migration completely.\nHowever, the implications for the agriculture sector, particularly dairy, are significant. Approximately half of the U.S. dairy industry's workforce consists of immigrant labor, many of whom are undocumented. The National Milk Producers Federation estimates that removing immigrant workers could decimate the dairy herd by 2.1 million cows and slash milk production by nearly 50 billion pounds, leading to a dramatic 90.4% increase in milk prices.\nThe complex perspectives of Americans on undocumented workers were highlighted in a Pew Research Center study. While 64% of U.S. adults support legal pathways for undocumented immigrants, 35% oppose it—a gap that has been narrowing recently. Factors influencing public opinion include the belief that immigrants should have jobs and pass security checks, contrasted by concerns about lawbreakers being rewarded, fairness for legal migrants, and resource allocation.\nAccording to Zach Rutledge, an agricultural economist at Michigan State University, as nations grow wealthier, their labor forces transition away from agriculture toward sectors like services and manufacturing. This shift has led to the U.S. relying heavily on immigrant labor for agricultural work. Domestic workers, even with employment taxes, may cost $15 to $25 an hour, while H-2A visa program workers might cost $25 to $30 an hour, accounting for additional housing expenses.\nThe National Milk Producers Federation has been vocal in advocating for changes to the H-2A visa program, which outside of its current seasonal limitations, does not support the dairy industry's year-round labor needs. Executive vice-president Jaime Castaneda reiterated the need for legislative clarity to address the undocumented workforce issues in dairy farming.\nThe Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2023, which could grant legal status to certain undocumented farmworkers, has been stalled in Congress, despite acknowledgment of the sector's importance to feeding America. The need for coordinated legislative efforts to ensure both border security and labor market stability is imperative moving forward.\n{}:\"\"\".format(source, target, source, target)\nNamed-entity recognition\nFor named-entity recognition tasks, you can use the following prompt template:\nAnalyse the following tokenized text and mark the tokens containing named entities.\nUse the following annotation guidelines with these tags for named entities:\n- ORG (Refers to named groups or organizations)\n- PER (Refers to individual people or named groups of people)\n- LOC (Refers to physical places or natural landmarks)\n- MISC (Refers to entities that don't fit into standard categories).\nPrepend B- to the first token of a given entity and I- to the remaining ones if they exist.\nIf a token is not a named entity, label it as O.\nInput: {list of words in a sentence}\nMarked:\nShow an example\ntext = \"\"\"Analyse the following tokenized text and mark the tokens containing named entities.\nUse the following annotation guidelines with these tags for named entities:\n- ORG (Refers to named groups or organizations)\n- PER (Refers to individual people or named groups of people)\n- LOC (Refers to physical places or natural landmarks)\n- MISC (Refers to entities that don't fit into standard categories).\nPrepend B- to the first token of a given entity and I- to the remaining ones if they exist.\nIf a token is not a named entity, label it as O.\nInput: ['La', 'defensa', 'del', 'antiguo', 'responsable', 'de', 'la', 'RFEF', 'confirma', 'que', 'interpondrá', 'un', 'recurso.']\nMarked: \"\"\"\n# [('La', 'O'), ('defensa', 'O'), ('del', 'O'), ('antiguo', 'O'), ('responsable', 'O'), ('de', 'O'), ('la', 'O'), ('RFEF', 'B-ORG'), ('confirma', 'O'), ('que', 'O'), ('interpondrá', 'O'), ('un', 'O'), ('recurso.', 'O')]\nGrammar checker\nFor fixing any mistakes in grammar, you can use the following prompt template:\nPlease fix any mistakes in the following {source} sentence or keep it unedited if it's correct.\nSentence: {sentence}\nCorrected:\nShow an example\nsource = 'Catalan'\nsentence = 'Entonses, el meu jefe m’ha dit que he de treballar els fins de setmana.'\ntext = f\"Please fix any mistakes in the following {source} sentence or keep it unedited if it's correct.\\nSentence: {sentence} \\nCorrected:\"\n# Llavors, el meu cap m'ha dit que he de treballar els caps de setmana.\nData\nPretraining Data\nThe pretraining corpus consists of 424 billion tokens of Catalan-centric, Spanish-centric, and English-centric parallel data,\nincluding all of the official European languages plus Catalan, Basque, Galician, Asturian, Aragonese and Aranese.\nIt amounts to 6,574,251,526 parallel sentence pairs.\nThis highly multilingual corpus is predominantly composed of data sourced from OPUS,\nwith additional data taken from the NTEU Project, Aina Project, and other sources\n(see: Data Sources and References).\nWhere little parallel Catalan <-> xx data could be found, synthetic Catalan data was generated from the Spanish side of the collected Spanish <-> xx corpora using\nProjecte Aina’s Spanish-Catalan model.

regard to MT models, the only analysis related to bias which we have conducted is the MT-GenEval evaluation.\nNo specific analysis has yet been carried out in order to evaluate potential biases or limitations in translation\naccuracy across different languages, dialects, or domains. However, we recognize the importance of identifying and addressing any harmful stereotypes,\ncultural inaccuracies, or systematic performance discrepancies that may arise in Machine Translation. As such, we plan to continue performing more analyses\nas we implement the necessary metrics and methods within our evaluation framework MT-Lens.\nNote that the model has only undergone preliminary instruction tuning.\nWe urge developers to consider potential limitations and conduct safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications.\nAdditional information\nAuthor\nThe Language Technologies Unit from Barcelona Supercomputing Center.\nContact\nFor further information, please send an email to langtech@bsc.es.\nCopyright\nCopyright(c) 2025 by Language Technologies Unit, Barcelona Supercomputing Center.\nFunding\nThis work has been promoted and financed by the Government of Catalonia through the Aina Project.\nThis work is funded by the Ministerio para la Transformación Digital y de la Función Pública - Funded by EU – NextGenerationEU\nwithin the framework of ILENIA Project with reference 2022/TL22/00215337.\nAcknowledgements\nThe success of this project has been made possible thanks to the invaluable contributions of our partners in the ILENIA Project:\nHiTZ, and CiTIUS.\nTheir efforts have been instrumental in advancing our work, and we sincerely appreciate their help and support.\nDisclaimer\nDisclaimer\nBe aware that the model may contain biases or other unintended distortions.\nWhen third parties deploy systems or provide services based on this model, or use the model themselves,\nthey bear the responsibility for mitigating any associated risks and ensuring compliance with applicable regulations,\nincluding those governing the use of Artificial Intelligence.\nThe Barcelona Supercomputing Center, as the owner and creator of the model, shall not be held liable for any outcomes resulting from third-party use.\nLicense\nApache License, Version 2.0\nCitation\nIf you find our model useful, we would appreciate if you could cite our work as follows:\n@misc{gilabert2025salamandrasalamandratabscsubmission,\ntitle={From SALAMANDRA to SALAMANDRATA: BSC Submission for WMT25 General Machine Translation Shared Task},\nauthor={Javier Garcia Gilabert and Xixian Liao and Severino Da Dalt and Ella Bohman and Audrey Mash and Francesca De Luca Fornaciari and Irene Baucells and Joan Llop and Miguel Claramunt Argote and Carlos Escolano and Maite Melero},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2508.12774},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.CL},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12774},\n}",

It accepts arbitrary sequences of image and text inputs to produce text outputs. It's designed for efficiency. SmolVLM can answer questions about images, describe visual content, or transcribe text. Its lightweight architecture makes it suitable for on-device applications while maintaining strong performance on multimodal tasks. It can run inference on one image with 1.23GB of GPU RAM.\nModel Summary\nDeveloped by: Hugging Face 🤗\nModel type: Multi-modal model (image+text)\nLanguage(s) (NLP): English\nLicense: Apache 2.0\nArchitecture: Based on Idefics3 (see technical summary)\nResources\nDemo: SmolVLM-256 Demo\nBlog: Blog post\nUses\nSmolVLM can be used for inference on multimodal (image + text) tasks where the input comprises text queries along with one or more images. Text and images can be interleaved arbitrarily, enabling tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and storytelling based on visual content. The model does not support image generation.\nTo fine-tune SmolVLM on a specific task, you can follow the fine-tuning tutorial.\nEvaluation\nTechnical Summary\nSmolVLM leverages the lightweight SmolLM2 language model to provide a compact yet powerful multimodal experience. It introduces several changes compared to the larger SmolVLM 2.2B model:\nImage compression: We introduce a more radical image compression compared to Idefics3 and SmolVLM-2.2B to enable the model to infer faster and use less RAM.\nVisual Token Encoding: SmolVLM-256 uses 64 visual tokens to encode image patches of size 512×512. Larger images are divided into patches, each encoded separately, enhancing efficiency without compromising performance.\nNew special tokens: We added new special tokens to divide the subimages. This allows for more efficient tokenization of the images.\nSmoller vision encoder: We went from a 400M parameter siglip vision encoder to a much smaller 93M encoder.\nLarger image patches: We are now passing patches of 512x512 to the vision encoder, instead of 384x384 like the larger SmolVLM. This allows the information to be encoded more efficiently.\nMore details about the training and architecture are available in our technical report.\nHow to get started\nYou can use transformers to load, infer and fine-tune SmolVLM.\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForVision2Seq\nfrom transformers.image_utils import load_image\nDEVICE = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\n# Load images\nimage = load_image(\"https://cdn.britannica.com/61/93061-050-99147DCE/Statue-of-Liberty-Island-New-York-Bay.jpg\")\n# Initialize processor and model\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-500M-Instruct\")\nmodel = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(\n\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-500M-Instruct\",\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n_attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\" if DEVICE == \"cuda\" else \"eager\",\n).to(DEVICE)\n# Create input messages\nmessages = [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"image\"},\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Can you describe this image?\"}\n]\n},\n]\n# Prepare inputs\nprompt = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True)\ninputs = processor(text=prompt, images=[image], return_tensors=\"pt\")\ninputs = inputs.to(DEVICE)\n# Generate outputs\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=500)\ngenerated_texts = processor.batch_decode(\ngenerated_ids,\nskip_special_tokens=True,\n)\nprint(generated_texts[0])\n\"\"\"\nAssistant: The image depicts a cityscape featuring a prominent landmark, the Statue of Liberty, prominently positioned on Liberty Island. The statue is a green, humanoid figure with a crown atop its head and is situated on a small island surrounded by water. The statue is characterized by its large, detailed structure, with a statue of a woman holding a torch above her head and a tablet in her left hand. The statue is surrounded by a small, rocky island, which is partially visible in the foreground.\nIn the background, the cityscape is dominated by numerous high-rise buildings, which are densely packed and vary in height. The buildings are primarily made of glass and steel, reflecting the sunlight and creating a bright, urban skyline. The skyline is filled with various architectural styles, including modern skyscrapers and older, more traditional buildings.\nThe water surrounding the island is calm, with a few small boats visible, indicating that the area is likely a popular tourist destination. The water is a deep blue, suggesting that it is a large body of water, possibly a river or a large lake.\nIn the foreground, there is a small strip of land with trees and grass, which adds a touch of natural beauty to the urban landscape. The trees are green, indicating that it is likely spring or summer.\nThe image captures a moment of tranquility and reflection, as the statue and the cityscape come together to create a harmonious and picturesque scene. The statue's presence in the foreground draws attention to the city's grandeur, while the calm water and natural elements in the background provide a sense of peace and serenity.\nIn summary, the image showcases the Statue of Liberty, a symbol of freedom and democracy, set against a backdrop of a bustling cityscape. The statue is a prominent and iconic representation of human achievement, while the cityscape is a testament to human ingenuity and progress. The image captures the beauty and complexity of urban life, with the statue serving as a symbol of hope and freedom, while the cityscape provides a glimpse into the modern world.\n\"\"\"\nModel optimizations\nPrecision: For better performance, load and run the model in half-precision (torch.bfloat16) if your hardware supports it.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForVision2Seq\nimport torch\nmodel = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(\n\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct\",\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16\n).to(\"cuda\")\nYou can also load SmolVLM with 4/8-bit quantization using bitsandbytes, torchao or Quanto. Refer to this page for other options.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForVision2Seq, BitsAndBytesConfig\nimport torch\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)\nmodel = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(\n\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct\",\nquantization_config=quantization_config,\n)\nVision Encoder Efficiency: Adjust the image resolution by setting size={\"longest_edge\": N*512} when initializing the processor, where N is your desired value. The default N=4 works well, which results in input images of\nsize 2048×2048. Decreasing N can save GPU memory and is appropriate for lower-resolution images. This is also useful if you want to fine-tune on videos.\nMisuse and Out-of-scope Use\nSmolVLM is not intended for high-stakes scenarios or critical decision-making processes that affect an individual's well-being or livelihood. The model may produce content that appears factual but may not be accurate. Misuse includes, but is not limited to:\nProhibited Uses:\nEvaluating or scoring individuals (e.g., in employment, education, credit)\nCritical automated decision-making\nGenerating unreliable factual content\nMalicious Activities:\nSpam generation\nDisinformation campaigns\nHarassment or abuse\nUnauthorized surveillance\nLicense\nSmolVLM is built upon SigLIP as image encoder and SmolLM2 for text decoder part.\nWe release the SmolVLM checkpoints under the Apache 2.0 license.\nTraining Details\nTraining Data\nThe training data comes from The Cauldron and Docmatix datasets, with emphasis on document understanding (25%) and image captioning (18%), while maintaining balanced coverage across other crucial capabilities like visual reasoning, chart comprehension, and general instruction following.\nCitation information\nYou can cite us in the following way:\n@article{marafioti2025smolvlm,\ntitle={SmolVLM: Redefining small and efficient multimodal models},\nauthor={Andrés Marafioti and Orr Zohar and Miquel Farré and Merve Noyan and Elie Bakouch and Pedro Cuenca and Cyril Zakka and Loubna Ben Allal and Anton Lozhkov and Nouamane Tazi and Vaibhav Srivastav and Joshua Lochner and Hugo Larcher and Mathieu Morlon and Lewis Tunstall and Leandro von Werra and Thomas Wolf},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.05299},\nyear={2025}\n}",

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1.\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.\nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n3.

    "stanfordmimi/MedVAE": "MedVAE: Efficient Automated Interpretation of Medical Images with Large-Scale Generalizable Autoencoders\nModel Description\nInstallation\nUsage\nCitation\nMedVAE: Efficient Automated Interpretation of Medical Images with Large-Scale Generalizable Autoencoders\nThe model was presented in the paper MedVAE: Efficient Automated Interpretation of Medical Images with Large-Scale Generalizable Autoencoders.\nAbstract: Medical images are acquired at high resolutions with large fields of view in order to capture fine-grained features necessary for clinical decision-making. Consequently, training deep learning models on medical images can incur large computational costs. In this work, we address the challenge of downsizing medical images in order to improve downstream computational efficiency while preserving clinically-relevant features. We introduce MedVAE, a family of six large-scale 2D and 3D autoencoders capable of encoding medical images as downsized latent representations and decoding latent representations back to high-resolution images. We train MedVAE autoencoders using a novel two-stage training approach with 1,052,730 medical images. Across diverse tasks obtained from 20 medical image datasets, we demonstrate that (1) utilizing MedVAE latent representations in place of high-resolution images when training downstream models can lead to efficiency benefits (up to 70x improvement in throughput) while simultaneously preserving clinically-relevant features and (2) MedVAE can decode latent representations back to high-resolution images with high fidelity. Our work demonstrates that large-scale, generalizable autoencoders can help address critical efficiency challenges in the medical domain.\nModel Description\nMedVAE is a family of six large-scale, generalizable 2D and 3D variational autoencoders (VAEs) designed for medical imaging. It is trained on over one million medical images across multiple anatomical regions and modalities. MedVAE autoencoders encode medical images as downsized latent representations and decode latent representations back to high-resolution images. Across diverse tasks obtained from 20 medical image datasets, we demonstrate that utilizing MedVAE latent representations in place of high-resolution images when training downstream models can lead to efficiency benefits (up to 70x improvement in throughput) while simultaneously preserving clinically-relevant features.\nTotal Compression Factor\nChannels\nDimensions\nModalities\nAnatomies\nConfig File\nModel File\n16\n1\n2D\nX-ray\nChest, Breast (FFDM)\nmedvae_4x1.yaml\nvae_4x_1c_2D.ckpt\n16\n3\n2D\nX-ray\nChest, Breast (FFDM)\nmedvae_4x3.yaml\nvae_4x_3c_2D.ckpt\n64\n1\n2D\nX-ray\nChest, Breast (FFDM)\nmedvae_8x1.yaml\nvae_8x_1c_2D.ckpt\n64\n3\n2D\nX-ray\nChest, Breast (FFDM)\nmedvae_8x4.yaml\nvae_8x_4c_2D.ckpt\n64\n1\n3D\nMRI, CT\nWhole-Body\nmedvae_4x1.yaml\nvae_4x_1c_3D.ckpt\n512\n1\n3D\nMRI, CT\nWhole-Body\nmedvae_8x1.yaml\nvae_8x_1c_3D.ckpt\nNote: Model weights and checkpoints are located in the model_weights folder.\nInstallation\nTo install MedVAE, you can simply run:\npip install medvae\nFor an editable installation, use the following commands to clone and install this repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAE.git\ncd MedVAE\npip install -e .[dev]\nUsage\nA simple example using the medvae library for inference:\nimport torch\nfrom medvae import MVAE\nfpath = \"documentation/data/mmg_data/isJV8hQ2hhJsvEP5rdQNiy.png\"  # Replace with your image path\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\nmodel = MVAE(model_name=\"medvae_4_3_2d\", modality=\"xray\").to(device)\nimg = model.apply_transform(fpath).to(device)\nmodel.requires_grad_(False)\nmodel.eval()\nwith torch.no_grad():\nlatent = model(img)\nWe also provide an easy-to-use CLI inference tool:\nmedvae_inference -i INPUT_FOLDER -o OUTPUT_FOLDER -model_name MED_VAE_MODEL -modality MODALITY\nFor more detailed instructions, refer to the Github repository.\nCitation\nIf you use MedVAE, please cite the original paper:\n@misc{varma2025medvaeefficientautomatedinterpretation,\ntitle={MedVAE: Efficient Automated Interpretation of Medical Images with Large-Scale Generalizable Autoencoders},\nauthor={Maya Varma and Ashwin Kumar and Rogier van der Sluijs and Sophie Ostmeier and Louis Blankemeier and Pierre Chambon and Christian Bluethgen and Jip Prince and Curtis Langlotz and Akshay Chaudhari},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2502.14753},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={eess.IV},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14753},\n}\nFor questions, please open an issue on the Github repository.",

They employ various policy tools and measures to achieve this objective.\nFirst, central banks employ monetary policy to influence aggregate demand and price levels. The primary policy tools include:\n1. Interest rates: Central banks adjust interest rates to manage the cost of borrowing and reduce inflation. Lower interest rates stimulate demand, while higher rates can curtail economic activity.\n2. Open market operations: Central banks buy or sell government securities to influence the money supply and drive economic growth.\n3. Government spending and taxation: Central banks influence fiscal policy to adjust government spending and taxation, which directly impacts economic activity and inflation.\nSecond, central banks utilize financial tools to stabilize the financial system and mitigate risks associated with high public debt and geopolitical uncertainties. Key measures include:\n1. Capital controls: Central banks set limits on the amount of capital available to financial institutions, which helps manage risk and prevent market bubbles.\n2. Financial regulations: Central banks introduce regulations to prevent excessive credit, debt, and fraud, which can contribute to inflation and systemic financial instability.\n3. Financial reform: Central banks work towards improving the regulatory framework and infrastructure to enhance financial stability and support economic growth.\nFurthermore, central banks consider the impact of geopolitical uncertainties on their operations. They implement measures to strengthen international relations, promote dialogue, and facilitate cooperation among countries to address global challenges collectively.\nIn conclusion, central banks balance the trade-off between controlling inflation and maintaining economic growth by employing a combination of monetary and financial policies, capital controls, regulatory reforms, and international cooperation.

However, this scaling approach introduces significant deployment challenges, including increased inference latency and memory usage. These challenges are particularly severe in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications, where large models' increased memory requirements constrain dataset ingestion capacity, and their higher latency directly impacts query-time performance. While causal language models have addressed similar efficiency challenges using Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, this approach hasn't been successfully adapted to the general text embedding setting. In this paper, we introduce Nomic Embed v2, the first general purpose MoE text embedding model. Our model outperforms models in the same parameter class on both monolingual and multilingual benchmarks while also maintaining competitive performance with models twice its size. We open-source all code, models, and evaluation data to ensure full reproducibility of our training pipeline at https://github.com/nomic-ai/contrastors.\nUsage Guide\nInstallation\nThe model can be used through SentenceTransformers and Transformers.\nFor best performance on GPU, please install\npip install torch transformers einops git+https://github.com/nomic-ai/megablocks.git\nImportant!\nThe text prompt must include a task instruction prefix, instructing the model which task is being performed.\nPlease use search_query:  before your queries/questions, and search_document:  before your documents.\nTransformers\nIf using Transformers, make sure to prepend the task instruction prefix.\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v2-moe\")\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v2-moe\", trust_remote_code=True)\nsentences = ['search_document: Hello!', 'search_document: ¡Hola!']\ndef mean_pooling(model_output, attention_mask):\ntoken_embeddings = model_output[0]\ninput_mask_expanded = attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1).expand(token_embeddings.size()).float()\nreturn torch.sum(token_embeddings * input_mask_expanded, 1) / torch.clamp(input_mask_expanded.sum(1), min=1e-9)\nencoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\nmodel.eval()\nwith torch.no_grad():\nmodel_output = model(**encoded_input)\nembeddings = mean_pooling(model_output, encoded_input['attention_mask'])\nembeddings = F.normalize(embeddings, p=2, dim=1)\nprint(embeddings.shape)\n# torch.Size([2, 768])\nsimilarity = F.cosine_similarity(embeddings[0], embeddings[1], dim=0)\nprint(similarity)\n# tensor(0.9118)\nFor truncation, you can trucate before applying normalization\n+ embeddings = embeddings[:, :matryoshka_dim]\nembeddings = F.normalize(embeddings, p=2, dim=1)\nSentenceTransformers\nWith SentenceTransformers, you can specify the prompt_name as either \"query\" or \"passage\", and the task instruction will be included automatically.\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\"nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v2-moe\", trust_remote_code=True)\nsentences = [\"Hello!\", \"¡Hola!\"]\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences, prompt_name=\"passage\")\nprint(embeddings.shape)\n# (2, 768)\nsimilarity = model.similarity(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])\nprint(similarity)\n# tensor([[0.9118]])\nFor truncation/Matryoshka embeddings, you can specify truncate_dim and use the model similarly\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\"nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v2-moe\", trust_remote_code=True, truncate_dim=256)\n...\nPerformance\nnomic-embed-text-v2-moe performance on BEIR and MIRACL compared to other open-weights embedding models:\nnomic-embed-text-v2-moe performance on BEIR at 768 dimension and truncated to 256 dimensions:\nBest Practices\nAdd appropriate prefixes to your text:\nFor queries: \"search_query: \"\nFor documents: \"search_document: \"\nMaximum input length is 512 tokens\nFor optimal efficiency, consider using the 256-dimension embeddings if storage/compute is a concern\nLimitations\nPerformance may vary across different languages\nResource requirements may be higher than traditional dense models due to MoE architecture\nMust use trust_remote_code=True when loading the model to use our custom architecture implementation\nTraining Details\nTrained on 1.6 billion high-quality pairs across multiple languages\nUses consistency filtering to ensure high-quality training data\nIncorporates Matryoshka representation learning for dimension flexibility\nTraining includes both weakly-supervised contrastive pretraining and supervised finetuning\nFor more details, please check out the blog post and technical report.\nJoin the Nomic Community\nNomic: https://nomic.ai\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/myY5YDR8z8\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nomic_ai\nCitation\nIf you find the model, dataset, or training code useful, please cite our work\n@misc{nussbaum2025trainingsparsemixtureexperts,\ntitle={Training Sparse Mixture Of Experts Text Embedding Models},\nauthor={Zach Nussbaum and Brandon Duderstadt},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2502.07972},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.CL},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07972},\n}",

LLM）的出现引发了全世界对AI的空前关注。\n无论是ChatGPT、DeepSeek还是Qwen，都以其惊艳的效果令人叹为观止。\n然而，动辄数百亿参数的庞大规模，使得它们对个人设备而言不仅难以训练，甚至连部署都显得遥不可及。\n打开大模型的“黑盒子”，探索其内部运作机制，多么令人心潮澎湃！\n遗憾的是，99%的探索只能止步于使用LoRA等技术对现有大模型进行少量微调，学习一些新指令或任务。\n这就好比教牛顿如何使用21世纪的智能手机——虽然有趣，却完全偏离了理解物理本质的初衷。\n与此同时，第三方的大模型框架和工具库，如transformers+trl，几乎只暴露了高度抽象的接口。\n通过短短10行代码，就能完成“加载模型+加载数据集+推理+强化学习”的全流程训练。\n这种高效的封装固然便利，但也像一架高速飞船，将我们与底层实现隔离开来，阻碍了深入探究LLM核心代码的机会。\n然而，“用乐高拼出一架飞机，远比坐在头等舱里飞行更让人兴奋！”。\n更糟糕的是，互联网上充斥着大量付费课程和营销号，以漏洞百出、一知半解的内容推销AI教程。\n正因如此，本项目初衷是拉低LLM的学习门槛，让每个人都能从理解每一行代码开始，\n从零开始亲手训练一个极小的语言模型。是的，从零开始训练，而不是仅仅进行推理！\n最低只需3块钱不到的服务器成本，就能亲身体验从0到1构建一个语言模型的全过程。\n一起感受创造的乐趣吧！\n（截至2025-02-07）MiniMind系列已完成多个型号模型的预训练，最小仅需25.8M（0.02B），即可具备流畅对话能力！\nModels

Tokenizer\n分词器将单词从自然语言通过“词典”映射到0, 1, 36这样的数字，可以理解为数字就代表了单词在“词典”中的页码。\n可以选择自己构造词表训练一个“词典”，代码可见./scripts/train_tokenizer.py（仅供学习参考，若非必要无需再自行训练，MiniMind已自带tokenizer）。\n或者选择比较出名的开源大模型分词器，\n正如同直接用新华/牛津词典的优点是token编码压缩率很好，缺点是页数太多，动辄数十万个词汇短语；\n自己训练的分词器，优点是词表长度和内容随意控制，缺点是压缩率很低（例如\"hello\"也许会被拆分为\"h e l l o\"\n五个独立的token），且生僻词难以覆盖。\n“词典”的选择固然很重要，LLM的输出本质上是SoftMax到词典N个词的多分类问题，然后通过“词典”解码到自然语言。\n因为MiniMind体积需要严格控制，为了避免模型头重脚轻（词嵌入embedding层参数在LLM占比太高），所以词表长度短短益善。\nTokenizer介绍\n第三方强大的开源模型例如Yi、qwen、chatglm、mistral、Llama3的tokenizer词表长度如下：\nTokenizer模型词表大小来源\nyi tokenizer64,00001万物（中国）\nqwen2 tokenizer151,643阿里云（中国）\nglm tokenizer151,329智谱AI（中国）\nmistral tokenizer32,000Mistral AI（法国）\nllama3 tokenizer128,000Meta（美国）\nminimind tokenizer6,400自定义\n👉2024-09-17更新：为了防止过去的版本歧义&控制体积，minimind所有模型均使用minimind_tokenizer分词，废弃所有mistral_tokenizer版本。\n# 一些自言自语\n> 尽管minimind_tokenizer长度很小，编解码效率弱于qwen2、glm等中文友好型分词器。\n> 但minimind模型选择了自己训练的minimind_tokenizer作为分词器，以保持整体参数轻量，避免编码层和计算层占比失衡，头重脚轻，因为minimind的词表大小只有6400。\n> 且minimind在实际测试中没有出现过生僻词汇解码失败的情况，效果良好。\n> 由于自定义词表压缩长度到6400，使得LLM总参数量最低只有25.8M。\n> 训练数据`tokenizer_train.jsonl`均来自于`匠数大模型数据集`，这部分数据相对次要，如需训练可以自由选择。\nⅡ Pretrain数据\n经历了MiniMind-V1的低质量预训练数据，导致模型胡言乱语的教训，2025-02-05 之后决定不再采用大规模无监督的数据集做预训练。\n进而尝试把匠数大模型数据集的中文部分提取出来，\n清洗出字符<512长度的大约1.6GB的语料直接拼接成预训练数据 pretrain_hq.jsonl，hq即为high\nquality（当然也还不算high，提升数据质量无止尽）。\n文件pretrain_hq.jsonl 数据格式为\n{\"text\": \"如何才能摆脱拖延症？ 治愈拖延症并不容易，但以下建议可能有所帮助...\"}\nⅢ SFT数据\n匠数大模型SFT数据集\n“是一个完整、格式统一、安全的大模型训练和研究资源。\n从网络上的公开数据源收集并整理了大量开源数据集，对其进行了格式统一，数据清洗，\n包含10M条数据的中文数据集和包含2M条数据的英文数据集。”\n以上是官方介绍，下载文件后的数据总量大约在4B tokens，肯定是适合作为中文大语言模型的SFT数据的。\n但是官方提供的数据格式很乱，全部用来sft代价太大。\n我将把官方数据集进行了二次清洗，把含有符号污染和噪声的条目去除；另外依然只保留了总长度<512\n的内容，此阶段希望通过大量对话补充预训练阶段欠缺的知识。\n导出文件为sft_512.jsonl(~7.5GB)。\nMagpie-SFT数据集\n收集了1M条来自Qwen2/2.5的高质量对话，我将这部分数据进一步清洗，把总长度<2048的部分导出为sft_2048.jsonl(9GB)。\n长度<1024的部分导出为sft_1024.jsonl(~5.5GB)，用大模型对话数据直接进行sft就属于“黑盒蒸馏”的范畴。\n进一步清洗前两步sft的数据（只保留中文字符占比高的内容），筛选长度<512的对话，得到sft_mini_512.jsonl(~1.2GB)。\n所有sft文件 sft_X.jsonl 数据格式均为\n{\n\"conversations\": [\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"你好\"},\n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"你好！\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"再见\"},\n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"再见！\"}\n]\n}\nⅣ RLHF数据\n来自Magpie-DPO数据集\n大约200k条偏好数据（均是英文）生成自Llama3.1-70B/8B，可以用于训练奖励模型，优化模型回复质量，使其更加符合人类偏好。\n这里将数据总长度<3000的内容重组为dpo.jsonl(~0.9GB)，包含chosen和rejected两个字段，chosen\n为偏好的回复，rejected为拒绝的回复。\n文件 dpo.jsonl 数据格式为\n{\n\"chosen\": [\n{\"content\": \"Q\", \"role\": \"user\"},\n{\"content\": \"good answer\", \"role\": \"assistant\"}\n],\n\"rejected\": [\n{\"content\": \"Q\", \"role\": \"user\"},\n{\"content\": \"bad answer\", \"role\": \"assistant\"}\n]\n}\nⅤ Reason数据集：\n不得不说2025年2月谁能火的过DeepSeek...\n也激发了我对RL引导的推理模型的浓厚兴趣，目前已经用Qwen2.5复现了R1-Zero。\n如果有时间+效果work（但99%基模能力不足）我会在之后更新MiniMind基于RL训练的推理模型而不是蒸馏模型。\n时间有限，最快的低成本方案依然是直接蒸馏（黑盒方式）。\n耐不住R1太火，短短几天就已经存在一些R1的蒸馏数据集R1-Llama-70B、R1-Distill-SFT、\nAlpaca-Distill-R1、\ndeepseek_r1_zh等等，纯中文的数据可能比较少。\n最终整合它们，导出文件为r1_mix_1024.jsonl，数据格式和sft_X.jsonl一致。\nⅥ 更多数据集\n目前已经有HqWu-HITCS/Awesome-Chinese-LLM\n在收集和梳理中文LLM相关的开源模型、应用、数据集及教程等资料，并持续更新这方面的最新进展。全面且专业，Respect！\nⅧ 数据集下载\n2025-02-05后，开源MiniMind最终训练所用的所有数据集，因此无需再自行预处理大规模数据集，避免重复性的数据处理工作。\nMiniMind训练数据集

Structure\nMiniMind-Dense（和Llama3.1一样）使用了Transformer的Decoder-Only结构，跟GPT-3的区别在于：\n采用了GPT-3的预标准化方法，也就是在每个Transformer子层的输入上进行归一化，而不是在输出上。具体来说，使用的是RMSNorm归一化函数。\n用SwiGLU激活函数替代了ReLU，这样做是为了提高性能。\n像GPT-Neo一样，去掉了绝对位置嵌入，改用了旋转位置嵌入（RoPE），这样在处理超出训练长度的推理时效果更好。\nMiniMind-MoE模型，它的结构基于Llama3和Deepseek-V2/3中的MixFFN混合专家模块。\nDeepSeek-V2在前馈网络（FFN）方面，采用了更细粒度的专家分割和共享的专家隔离技术，以提高Experts的效果。\nMiniMind的整体结构一致，只是在RoPE计算、推理函数和FFN层的代码上做了一些小调整。\n其结构如下图（重绘版）：\n修改模型配置见./model/LMConfig.py。\n参考模型参数版本见下表：\nModel

full_sft_512_zero.pth（见下文MiniMind模型文件链接），如有兴趣可下载检验此模型效果。\nⅡ 主要训练步骤\n1. 预训练(Pretrain):\nLLM首先要学习的并非直接与人交流，而是让网络参数中充满知识的墨水，“墨水” 理论上喝的越饱越好，产生大量的对世界的知识积累。\n预训练就是让Model先埋头苦学大量基本的知识，例如从Wiki百科、新闻、书籍整理大规模的高质量训练数据。\n这个过程是“无监督”的，即人类不需要在过程中做任何“有监督”的校正，而是由模型自己从大量文本中总结规律学习知识点。\n模型此阶段目的只有一个：学会词语接龙。例如我们输入“秦始皇”四个字，它可以接龙“是中国的第一位皇帝”。\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_pretrain.py # 1即为单卡训练，可根据硬件情况自行调整 (设置>=2)\n# or\npython train_pretrain.py\n训练后的模型权重文件默认每隔100步保存为: pretrain_*.pth（*\n为模型具体dimension，每次保存时新文件会覆盖旧文件）\n2. 有监督微调(Supervised Fine-Tuning):\n经过预训练，LLM此时已经掌握了大量知识，然而此时它只会无脑地词语接龙，还不会与人聊天。\nSFT阶段就需要把半成品LLM施加一个自定义的聊天模板进行微调。\n例如模型遇到这样的模板【问题->回答，问题->回答】后不再无脑接龙，而是意识到这是一段完整的对话结束。\n称这个过程为指令微调，就如同让已经学富五车的「牛顿」先生适应21世纪智能手机的聊天习惯，学习屏幕左侧是对方消息，右侧是本人消息这个规律。\n在训练时，MiniMind的指令和回答长度被截断在512，是为了节省显存空间。就像我们学习时，会先从短的文章开始，当学会写作200字作文后，800字文章也可以手到擒来。\n在需要长度拓展时，只需要准备少量的2k/4k/8k长度对话数据进行进一步微调即可（此时最好配合RoPE-NTK的基准差值）。\n在推理时通过调整RoPE线性差值，实现免训练长度外推到2048及以上将会很方便。\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_full_sft.py\n# or\npython train_full_sft.py\n训练后的模型权重文件默认每隔100步保存为: full_sft_*.pth（*\n为模型具体dimension，每次保存时新文件会覆盖旧文件）\nⅢ 其它训练步骤\n3. 人类反馈强化学习(Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, RLHF)\n在前面的训练步骤中，模型已经具备了基本的对话能力，但是这样的能力完全基于单词接龙，缺少正反样例的激励。\n模型此时尚未知什么回答是好的，什么是差的。我们希望它能够更符合人的偏好，降低让人类不满意答案的产生概率。\n这个过程就像是让模型参加新的培训，从优秀员工的作为例子，消极员工作为反例，学习如何更好地回复。\n此处使用的是RLHF系列之-直接偏好优化(Direct Preference Optimization, DPO)。\n与PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization)这种需要奖励模型、价值模型的RL算法不同；\nDPO通过推导PPO奖励模型的显式解，把在线奖励模型换成离线数据，Ref模型输出可以提前保存。\nDPO性能几乎不变，只用跑 actor_model 和 ref_model 两个模型，大大节省显存开销和增加训练稳定性。\n注：RLHF训练步骤并非必须，此步骤难以提升模型“智力”而通常仅用于提升模型的“礼貌”，有利（符合偏好、减少有害内容）也有弊（样本收集昂贵、反馈偏差、多样性损失）。\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_dpo.py\n# or\npython train_dpo.py\n训练后的模型权重文件默认每隔100步保存为: rlhf_*.pth（*\n为模型具体dimension，每次保存时新文件会覆盖旧文件）\n4. 知识蒸馏(Knowledge Distillation, KD)\n在前面的所有训练步骤中，模型已经完全具备了基本能力，通常可以学成出师了。\n而知识蒸馏可以进一步优化模型的性能和效率，所谓知识蒸馏，即学生模型面向教师模型学习。\n教师模型通常是经过充分训练的大模型，具有较高的准确性和泛化能力。\n学生模型是一个较小的模型，目标是学习教师模型的行为，而不是直接从原始数据中学习。\n在SFT学习中，模型的目标是拟合词Token分类硬标签（hard labels），即真实的类别标签（如 0 或 6400）。\n在知识蒸馏中，教师模型的softmax概率分布被用作软标签（soft labels）。小模型仅学习软标签，并使用KL-Loss来优化模型的参数。\n通俗地说，SFT直接学习老师给的解题答案。而KD过程相当于“打开”老师聪明的大脑，尽可能地模仿老师“大脑”思考问题的神经元状态。\n例如，当老师模型计算1+1=2这个问题的时候，最后一层神经元a状态为0，神经元b状态为100，神经元c状态为-99...\n学生模型通过大量数据，学习教师模型大脑内部的运转规律。这个过程即称之为：知识蒸馏。\n知识蒸馏的目的只有一个：让小模型体积更小的同时效果更好。\n然而随着LLM诞生和发展，模型蒸馏一词被广泛滥用，从而产生了“白盒/黑盒”知识蒸馏两个派别。\nGPT-4这种闭源模型，由于无法获取其内部结构，因此只能面向它所输出的数据学习，这个过程称之为黑盒蒸馏，也是大模型时代最普遍的做法。\n黑盒蒸馏与SFT过程完全一致，只不过数据是从大模型的输出收集，因此只需要准备数据并且进一步FT即可。\n注意更改被加载的基础模型为full_sft_*.pth，即基于微调模型做进一步的蒸馏学习。\n./dataset/sft_1024.jsonl与./dataset/sft_2048.jsonl 均收集自qwen2.5-7/72B-Instruct大模型，可直接用于SFT以获取Qwen的部分行为。\n# 注意需要更改train_full_sft.py数据集路径，以及max_seq_len\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_full_sft.py\n# or\npython train_full_sft.py\n训练后的模型权重文件默认每隔100步同样保存为: full_sft_*.pth（*为模型具体dimension，每次保存时新文件会覆盖旧文件）\n此处应当着重介绍MiniMind实现的白盒蒸馏代码train_distillation.py，由于MiniMind同系列本身并不存在强大的教师模型，因此白盒蒸馏代码仅作为学习参考。\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_distillation.py\n# or\npython train_distillation.py\n5. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)\nLoRA是一种高效的参数高效微调（Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, PEFT）方法，旨在通过低秩分解的方式对预训练模型进行微调。\n相比于全参数微调（Full Fine-Tuning），LoRA 只需要更新少量的参数。\nLoRA 的核心思想是：在模型的权重矩阵中引入低秩分解，仅对低秩部分进行更新，而保持原始预训练权重不变。\n代码可见./model/model_lora.py和train_lora.py，完全从0实现LoRA流程，不依赖第三方库的封装。\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_lora.py\n# or\npython train_lora.py\n训练后的模型权重文件默认每隔100步保存为: lora_xxx_*.pth（*\n为模型具体dimension，每次保存时新文件会覆盖旧文件）\n非常多的人困惑，如何使模型学会自己私有领域的知识？如何准备数据集？如何迁移通用领域模型打造垂域模型？\n这里举几个例子，对于通用模型，医学领域知识欠缺，可以尝试在原有模型基础上加入领域知识，以获得更好的性能。\n同时，我们通常不希望学会领域知识的同时损失原有基础模型的其它能力，此时LoRA可以很好的改善这个问题。\n只需要准备如下格式的对话数据集放置到./dataset/lora_xxx.jsonl，启动 python train_lora.py\n训练即可得到./out/lora/lora_xxx.pth新模型权重。\n医疗场景\n{\"conversations\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"请问颈椎病的人枕头多高才最好？\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"颈椎病患者选择枕头的高度应该根据...\"}]}\n{\"conversations\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"请问xxx\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"xxx...\"}]}\n自我认知场景\n{\"conversations\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"你叫什么名字？\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"我叫minimind...\"}]}\n{\"conversations\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"你是谁\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"我是...\"}]}\n此时【基础模型+LoRA模型】即可获得医疗场景模型增强的能力，相当于为基础模型增加了LoRA外挂，这个过程并不损失基础模型的本身能力。\n我们可以通过eval_model.py进行模型评估测试。\n# 注意：model_mode即选择基础模型的类型，这和train_lora是基于哪个模型训练的相关，确保统一即可。\npython eval_model.py --lora_name 'lora_medical' --model_mode 2\n小测试\n👶: 我最近经常感到头晕，可能是什么原因？\n🤖️: 头晕可能是由于多种原因，包括但不限于：心脏疾病、眼睛损伤、过敏反应、皮肤问题、过敏反应、压力、焦虑、疲劳、药物副作用、性功能障碍或者其他...\n---\n👶: 你和openai是什么关系？\n🤖️: 我是 MiniMind，一个由 Jingyao Gong 开发的人工智能助手。我通过自然语言处理和算法训练来与用户进行交互。\nPS：只要有所需要的数据集，也可以full_sft全参微调（需要进行通用知识的混合配比，否则过拟合领域数据会让模型变傻，损失通用性）\n6. 训练推理模型 (Reasoning Model)\nDeepSeek-R1实在太火了，几乎重新指明了未来LLM的新范式。\n论文指出>3B的模型经历多次反复的冷启动和RL奖励训练才能获得肉眼可见的推理能力提升。\n最快最稳妥最经济的做法，以及最近爆发的各种各样所谓的推理模型几乎都是直接面向数据进行蒸馏训练，\n但由于缺乏技术含量，蒸馏派被RL派瞧不起（hhhh）。\n本人迅速已经在Qwen系列1.5B小模型上进行了尝试，很快复现了Zero过程的数学推理能力。\n然而一个遗憾的共识是：参数太小的模型直接通过冷启动SFT+GRPO几乎不可能获得任何推理效果。\nMiniMind2第一时间只能坚定不移的选择做蒸馏派，日后基于0.1B模型的RL如果同样取得小小进展会更新此部分的训练方案。\n做蒸馏需要准备的依然是和SFT阶段同样格式的数据即可，数据集来源已如上文介绍。数据格式例如：\n{\n\"conversations\": [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": \"你好，我是小芳，很高兴认识你。\"\n},\n{\n\"role\": \"assistant\",\n\"content\": \"<think>\\n你好！我是由中国的个人开发者独立开发的智能助手MiniMind-R1-Lite-Preview，很高兴为您提供服务！\\n</think>\\n<answer>\\n你好！我是由中国的个人开发者独立开发的智能助手MiniMind-R1-Lite-Preview，很高兴为您提供服务！\\n</answer>\"\n}\n]\n}\n推理模型R1的回复模板是：\n<think>\\n思考过程\\n</think>\\n\n<answer>\\n最终回答\\n</answer>\n这在GRPO中通过设置规则奖励函数约束模型符合思考标签和回复标签（在冷启动靠前的阶段奖励值设置应该提高一些）\n另一个问题是蒸馏过程虽然和SFT一样，但实验结果是模型难以每次都符合模板规范的回复，即脱离思考和回复标签约束。\n这里的小技巧是增加标记位置token的损失惩罚，详见train_distill_reason.py:\n# 在 sp_ids 对应的位置增加额外的惩罚\n...\nloss_mask[sp_ids] = 10 # 惩罚系数\n另另一个tips是由于推理数据由于只筛选了<1024长度的数据，其中多轮对话和英文数据偏少，\n因此r1_mix_1024.jsonl进行了大约10k条多轮对话+英文数据的混合，防止模型遗忘严重。\n脚本默认基于rlhf后的基模型做推理能力的蒸馏微调，下面直接启动训练即可：\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node 1 train_distill_reason.py\n#

模型参数设定\n📋关于LLM的参数配置，有一篇很有意思的论文MobileLLM做了详细的研究和实验。\nScaling Law在小模型中有自己独特的规律。\n引起Transformer参数成规模变化的参数几乎只取决于d_model和n_layers。\nd_model↑ + n_layers↓ -> 矮胖子\nd_model↓ + n_layers↑ -> 瘦高个\n2020年提出Scaling Law的论文认为，训练数据量、参数量以及训练迭代次数才是决定性能的关键因素，而模型架构的影响几乎可以忽视。\n然而似乎这个定律对小模型并不完全适用。\nMobileLLM提出架构的深度比宽度更重要，「深而窄」的「瘦长」模型可以学习到比「宽而浅」模型更多的抽象概念。\n例如当模型参数固定在125M或者350M时，30～42层的「狭长」模型明显比12层左右的「矮胖」模型有更优越的性能，\n在常识推理、问答、阅读理解等8个基准测试上都有类似的趋势。\n这其实是非常有趣的发现，因为以往为100M左右量级的小模型设计架构时，几乎没人尝试过叠加超过12层。\n这与MiniMind在训练过程中，模型参数量在d_model和n_layers之间进行调整实验观察到的效果是一致的。\n然而「深而窄」的「窄」也是有维度极限的，当d_model<512时，词嵌入维度坍塌的劣势非常明显，\n增加的layers并不能弥补词嵌入在固定q_head带来d_head不足的劣势。\n当d_model>1536时，layers的增加似乎比d_model的优先级更高，更能带来具有“性价比”的参数->效果增益。\n因此MiniMind设定small模型dim=512，n_layers=8来获取的「极小体积<->更好效果」的平衡。\n设定dim=768，n_layers=16来获取效果的更大收益，更加符合小模型Scaling-Law的变化曲线。\n作为参考，GPT3的参数设定见下表：\nⅤ

长江，位于中国东南部，是中国的第一长河，全长6300多公里，流经11个省份，是中国最长的河流，也是中国的“母亲河”。长江的历史可以追溯到公元前2000多年的商朝时期，当时的商朝是商朝的后裔。商朝时期，长江的经济发展达到了高峰，是中国最重要的农业和工业中心之一。长江流域的经济主要以农业为主，长江渔业占据了主要产业，如钓鱼、猎鱼等。长江的水资源也非常丰富，包括河流、湖泊、河流等。长江的自然景观也十分壮观，长江四季景色各异，春季多雨，夏季多雨，秋季则多雨，冬季则寒冷多雪，春季和秋季都有美丽的花朵和果实。长江是中国的经济中心，拥有众多的国家和城市，是世界上重要的交通枢纽和航运中心。同时，长江还是中国的重要水利资源，对于中国的经济发展具有重要意义。\n[B]: 是的，我知道长江。长江位于中国的中部，是中国第三长的河流，全长约6300公里，流经江西省、安徽省、江苏省、安徽省、江苏省和安徽省。\n[C]: 当然，长江是中国最长的河流，全长约6300公里。它以其丰富的水资源、丰富的水生动植物资源以及独特的地理位置而闻名于世。\n[D]: 是的，长江是中国最长的河流，全长超过3300千米。\n[E]: 长江是中国最长的河流，总长度约为6300公里。它发源于青藏高原的青海湖，流经青海、四川、甘肃、宁夏、内蒙古、陕西和山西。长江流域是中国最大的农业区之一，也是中国的文化和经济中心。\n[F]: 是的，长江是中国最长的河流之一，也是世界第三大河流。长江发源于青藏高原，流经11个省份，最终注入东海。长江流域是中国最大的河流流域之一，拥有着丰富的自然资源和文化遗产，如长江大桥、长江海洋博物馆、长江古城等。\n[G]: 同时也知道，中国是世界上最长的城市之一，拥有超过3400万人口。\n[H]: 是的，长江是中国最长的河流，也是世界上最长的河流之一。它发源于青藏高原，流经九个省区，最终注入东海。长江流域的气候温和，四季分明，是中国重要的农业和工业基地。长江流域的水产资源丰富，是中国的重要渔业资源之一。\n[Q]: 世界上最高的山峰是什么？\n[A]: 世界上最高的山峰是珠穆朗玛峰（Mount Everest），位于喜马拉雅山脉，尼泊尔和中国的边界上。它的海拔高度是8,848.86米（29,031.7英尺），是地球上最高的山峰。\n[B]: 珠穆朗玛峰（Mount Everest）是世界上最高的山峰，海拔高度达8,848米（29,029英尺）。\n[C]: 珠穆朗玛峰是世界上最高的山峰，位于喜马拉雅山脉，海拔8,848.86米（29,031.7英尺）。它位于尼泊尔和中国的边界上，是喜马拉雅山脉的一部分。\n[D]: 世界上最高的山峰是珠穆朗玛峰，位于尼泊尔和中国的边境上，海拔8848米。\n[E]: 世界上最高的山峰是珠穆朗玛峰，位于喜马拉雅山脉，海拔8,848米。\n[F]: 珠穆朗玛峰是世界上最高的山峰，海拔8848米。\n[G]: 世界上最高的山峰是珠穆朗玛峰，位于喜马拉雅山脉，海拔8,848.86米（29,031.69英尺）。\n[H]: 世界上最高的山峰是珠穆朗玛峰，也称为萨加玛塔，位于喜马拉雅山脉的尼泊尔和中国边境之间，海拔8,848.86米（29,031.69英尺）。它是世界上最著名的登山目标之一，吸引着来自世界各地的登山者前来挑战。珠穆朗玛峰的名字来自藏语，意思是“女神的额峰”，它是由两个不同的山峰组成的，其中一个是位于尼泊尔的珠穆朗玛峰，另一个则位于中国。它的高度是通过测量海拔高度来确定的，因为它是通过测量地球的平均高度来确定的。尽管珠穆朗玛峰是世界上最高的山峰，但它并不是地球上任何其他地方都能到达的。地球上的其他地方，如南美洲的安第斯山脉，也是世界上最高的山脉，但它并不是地球上最高的山峰。总之，珠穆朗玛峰是世界上最高的山峰，但它并不是地球上任何地方都能到达的。它是地球上最高的山脉，但它并不是地球上任何地方都能到达的。\n[Q]: 万有引力是谁提出的？\n[A]: 万有引力是由牛顿在17世纪提出的，它是牛顿三大定律之一。牛顿在17世纪提出的引力定律揭示了万有引力定律的本质，并且解释了行星、卫星、彗星等天体之间如何相互作用。这个定律是由艾萨克·牛顿在1687年提出的，他通过对万有引力定律的分析和实验，成功地解释了天体之间的引力作用，从而解释了地球绕太阳旋转的现象。\n[B]: 万有引力（Human Policy）是牛顿的三大力学定律，用于描述两个物体之间的相互作用力。它由万有引力定律和牛顿的第一定律（惯性定律）构成。万有引力是由于两个物体之间相互作用而产生的，它们的质量、距离、速度和方向等因素决定了它们之间的相互作用。这种相互作用力是：质量的乘积：质量的乘积是万有引力定律和牛顿第二定律的乘积。质量的乘积：质量的乘积是物体之间的一种物理过程，它是物体间相互作用的产物，对于其他物体来说，其质量可以表示为两个物体之间的质量之和，即重力加速度a。\n[C]: 万有引力是一个由牛顿在1687年提出的物理学概念，它描述了物体之间引力如何相互作用的规律。\n[D]: 万有引力是由英国物理学家牛顿提出的。他认为，所有物体都会产生引力，这个引力是由物体的质量和距离决定的。这个理论揭示了质量和距离之间的关系，并证明了万有引力的本质。\n[E]: 万有引力是由牛顿在1687年提出的。它是宇宙中一个基本的物理现象，它描述了物体之间的相互作用。这个力被称为万有引力，它在所有物体之间都存在，这种力与物体的质量和距离有关。万有引力是自然界中最基本的力量之一，它不仅影响着物体的运动和变化，还对宇宙的结构和演化产生着重要的影响。\n[F]: 万有引力是英国物理学家艾萨克·牛顿在17世纪提出的。\n[G]: 引力是宇宙中一种力量，它是由质量或能量所组成的。根据牛顿的万有引力定律，一个物体之间的引力大小与它的质量成正比，与它的质量成反比。因此，牛顿的万有引力定律表明，一个物体之间的引力大小与它的质量成正比，与它的质量成反比。这个定律在物理学、天文学和物理学中都有广泛的应用。\n[H]: 万有引力是由英国物理学家艾萨克·牛顿于1687年提出的。他在1687年发表了一篇著名的论文，题为《自然哲学的数学原理》，其中提出了万有引力定律，指出任何两个物体之间都存在着一种引力，这种引力的大小与它们的质量成正比，与它们之间的距离的平方成反比。这个定律被称为万有引力定律，它描述了质量和距离之间的关系。它表明，两个物体之间的引力与它们的质量成正比，与它们之间的距离的平方成反比。这个定律对于解释宇宙中的许多现象和现象之间的相互作用非常重要，例如行星绕太阳运动、恒星之间的引力透镜效应等等。它也被广泛应用于天文学、物理学和工程学等领域，为我们理解宇宙的本质和演化提供了重要的理论基础。\n[Q]: 你知道大熊猫的主要食物是什么吗？\n[A]: 大熊猫主要以竹子为食，但也会吃其他植物、昆虫、小型哺乳动物和鱼类。它们的消化系统与其他熊科动物类似，能够消化竹子。大熊猫的牙齿锋利，适合咀嚼竹子，因此它们经常被称为“竹食动物”。\n[B]: 大熊猫是以竹子为食的哺乳动物，它们是肉食动物。它们主要食物是竹子，特别是竹子中富含纤维素和矿物质，并且不会直接进入消化系统。大熊猫的肠道主要由竹子组成，它们需要消化竹子中的纤维素和其他纤维素来支持它们的正常进食。\n[C]: 大熊猫主要以竹子为食，但它们也吃其他植物，包括树叶、嫩芽、昆虫、水果、蔬菜和小型哺乳动物等。大熊猫是中国特有的物种，属于熊科，主要分布在中国的四川、陕西和甘肃等地。\n[D]: 大熊猫的主要食物是竹子。它们通常吃竹子，每天需要吃掉大约30公斤的竹子。\n[E]: 是的，大熊猫主要以竹子为食。它们每天需要吃掉大量的竹子来维持生命，每天需要吃掉40至80公斤的竹子。此外，它们也会吃一些其他的植物，如草、果实、坚果和小型哺乳动物。\n[F]: 大熊猫主要以竹子为食，也会偶尔食用其他的植物和动物。此外，大熊猫也会吃一些野果、小动物和植物，但这些都不属于它们的主要食物来源。\n[G]: 大熊猫的主要食物是竹子。\n[H]: 大熊猫是一种以竹子为主要食物的植食动物，它们的肠道结构适合消化纤维素含量高的竹子，但也会吃一些其他植物，如草本植物和小型哺乳动物。大熊猫的肠道结构也适应了高纤维的竹子，这使得它们能够消化大量的纤维素，从而帮助它们在野外生存。大熊猫的肠道中还含有一种叫做“纤维素酶”的酶类物质，这种酶能够帮助大熊猫分解纤维素，从而帮助它们消化大量的水分和营养物质。此外，大熊猫的肠道还含有一种叫做“纤维素蛋白”的蛋白质，这种蛋白质能够帮助大熊猫维持体内的能量水平，从而帮助它们在野外生存。总的来说，大熊猫的主要食物是竹子，但它们也会吃一些其他植物，如草本植物和小型哺乳动物。\n[Q]: 海水为什么是咸的？\n[A]: 海水之所以是咸的，主要是由于其中的化学成分。海水中含有大量的矿物质和盐分，其中主要成分是硫酸盐、碳酸盐、镁离子和钾离子。这些物质在高浓度下，会沉淀在海水中，形成海水。具体来说，海水中的矿物质和盐分主要来自于岩石、土壤、生物和人类排泄物等。岩石是海水的组成部分，主要由矿物质组成，如石英、长石、云母等。土壤中含有大量的化学物质，如氮、磷、钾等，这些物质会渗透到土壤中，形成土壤。生物体内的盐分主要来源于植物的叶绿素等色素，这些色素会吸收太阳光中的能量，转化为生物体可以利用的能量。而人类排泄物中含有的盐分主要来源于矿物质和碳酸盐，这些矿物质在水中的浓度较高，会导致水中溶解的矿物质浓度增加，形成水体中的盐分。因此，海水之所以是咸的，是由于其中的化学成分和结构特征。海水中的矿物质和盐分主要来自于岩石、土壤、生物和人类排泄物等，而这些物质的积累和排泄会导致海水呈现出咸味。\n[B]: 海水是咸的，因为它包含了多种物质，包括氯化钠（NaCl）、氯化钠（NaCl）、碳酸盐（如硫酸盐）、氯化钠（NaCl）和水。咸物质的来源：盐是咸的常见来源，含有钾、钙、镁、钾等矿物质。这些矿物质通常来自于地下水、地下水或土壤中，这些矿物质的含量远低于纯净水。咸味的原因：盐的咸味主要源于其溶解于水中的微小颗粒物。这些小颗粒物主要通过植物根部和动物体内的微生物传播，如昆虫、小型哺乳动物、鸟类和某些昆虫。综上所述，海水是咸的，因为它含有大量的盐类，包括矿物质、岩石、盐、矿物质等，这些物质在海水中的浓度高，对咸味的产生较大影响。\n[C]: 海水是咸的，主要是因为其中含有各种盐分，其中以海水为主要成分之一。当海水中含有大量的盐分时，盐分会被溶解在海水中，形成咸味。海水中的盐分主要来源于溶解盐类、蒸发析出的盐和海水冻结成冰等因素。\n[D]: 海水中含有许多盐分，这些盐分可以导致海水咸度的增加。海水中的盐分主要来自于海水中的盐分，这些盐分可以从海水中的盐分中获得。海水中的氧化物和盐分可以与海水中的盐分形成氢键，从而使海水咸度增加。\n[E]: 海水是咸的，这是因为它含有大量的盐分，其中包括氯离子和氯离子。这些离子在海洋中形成了大量的盐，这些盐分被称为盐分。海水中含有许多溶解在水中的盐，这些盐分会随着海水的升高而逐渐蒸发，最终导致海水中盐分的蒸发。这些盐分在海水中被完全消耗，然后被排除在海水中。此外，海水中还含有许多其他的盐分，但这些盐分是不同的，因为它们在水中的浮起和下降过程是不同的。海水中的盐分是从海底的岩石中提取出来的，这些盐分在海水中可以被利用。总的来说，海水是咸的，这也是为什么海水中含有许多盐分和盐分的原因。\n[F]: 海水含有许多溶解的盐类，其中最主要的是氯化钠。当水中加入盐时，盐的分子会与水分子发生反应，形成氢氧化钠，这是一种盐。\n[G]: 因为水是许多生物的生存所必需的，它能够吸收和释放二氧化碳，释放氧气，维持大气中的水蒸气，以及维持水循环。水中的盐类和化学物质会释放出氧气，使地球上的生物呼吸。此外，水还具有许多其他功能，如保持水循环、维持水循环、调节气候和环境等。水是许多生物生存所必需的，它也是许多自然现象的重要基础。\n[H]: 海水是咸的主要原因是因为其中含有大量的溶解盐类，其中最主要的是氯化钠（NaCl）。氯化钠是一种非常常见的盐类，它存在于地球上的大部分地区，包括海洋、湖泊、河流和地下水。当水从海洋中蒸发时，它会带走一部分盐分，使海水变得咸。此外，海中还含有其他溶解盐类的物质，如硫酸盐、硫酸镁、硫酸钙、硫酸镁盐、硫酸镁钾、硫酸镁钠、硫酸镁钙、硫酸镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁钠、硫酸镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁镁镁镁钙、硫酸镁镁镁镁\n[Q]: 写一段python的快速排序代码\n[A]: 好的，以下是Python的快速排序代码：def quick_sort(arr):    if len(arr) <= 1:        return arr    else:        pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]        left = [x for x in arr[1:]]        right = [x for x in arr[2:] if x < pivot]        return quick_sort(left) + [pivot] + quick_sort(right)# 测试代码arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]print(quick_sort(arr))这段代码首先检查数组的长度是否小于等于1。如果是，那么它就按照从小到大的顺序排列。接着，对于数组的每个元素，它想要进行递归地排序，直到达到排序的结束位置。如果数组的长度是奇数，那么它就按照从大到小的顺序排列。最后，平均的时间复杂度是O(n log n)，其中n是数组的长度。\n[B]: 以下是一个使用Python的快速排序算法的实现：def sort_array(arr):    # 生成一个随机排列    sorted_array = sorted(arr)    # 返回排序后的列表    return sorted(arr)# 示例arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]# 调用函数sorted_array = sort_array(arr)print(\"原始数组是：\", sorted_array)这段代码首先生成一个随机排列，然后通过一个列表的长度进行排序。最后，返回排序后的列表。注意，这个代码使用了Python的内置sorted函数和内置的sorted()函数，它们在时间复杂度为O(n log n)的情况下，比直接使用sorted()函数更快。\n[C]: 以下是一个简单的排序算法，适用于小型数组，包括小于等于5的数组。def quick_sort(arr):    if len(arr) <= 1:        return arr    else    for _ in range(2, 51):        if arr[len(arr) - 1:] is not None:            arr[len(arr) - 1] = arr[len(arr) - 1]                arr[len(arr)] = arr[len(arr)]    return quick_sort(arr)# 示例arr = [3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1]sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)print(\"Sorted array is:\", sorted_arr)### 代码解释：1. **函数定义**：quick_sort 函数接受一个数组 arr 作为参数。2. **循环**：对于 arr 的元素，使用递归来实现，即从右到左遍历数组，并将当前元素与数组的当前元素交换位置，直到数组达到空或数组长度小于等于 arr。3. **递归调用**：遍历数组，将当前元素与数组的当前元素进行交换，直到数组达到空或数组长度小于等于 arr。4. **检查数组长度**：使用 if __name__ == \"__main__\" 检查数组的长度是否小于 arr，如果是，就将数组从较大的数组移动到数组的末尾。5. **输出排序后的结果**\n[D]: 作为一个AI语言模型，我无法编写Python程序。但是，Python是一个非常流行的编程语言，它具有许多优秀的库和框架，包括NumPy、Pandas、Matplotlib、Pandas、Bandke、Norm和NKlearn等。Python有很多优秀的自然语言处理库和框架，可以用于处理和分析各种类型的数据，如文本、图像、音频、视频等。Python还可以用于创建各种应用程序，如网页搜索、游戏开发、科学计算等。Python非常灵活，也支持多种编程风格，因此可以轻松地找到适合自己的解决方案。\n[E]: 作为AI语言模型，我可以回答您的问题。但是我无法进行编程操作，因为我无法确定您想问的是哪种编程语言。请您提供更具体的问题，以便我能够更好地回答您的问题。\n[F]: 快速排序（Quick Sort）是一种简单的排序算法，它通过将数据划分为小组，每组数据按照一定规则排序，最终得到一个有序数组。\n[G]: 好的，以下是一段快速排序的Python代码输出结果为：\n[H]: 快速排序是一种基于分治思想的高效排序算法，它的时间复杂度为 O(n log n)。它的基本思想是通过一趟排序将待排序序列划分为两个子序列，其中一个子序列的所有元素都比另一个子序列的所有元素小，然后对这两个子序列分别递归地进行排序。下面是一个 Python 代码示例，实现了快速排序算法：该代码使用了递归的方式，首先判断数组的长度是否小于等于1，如果是，则直接返回数组，否则递归地对数组进行排序。在递归过程中，我们首先判断数组的第一个元素是否大于等于1，如果是，则将数组中的元素与第一个元素进行比较，如果不等于1，则将数组中的元素与第二个元素进行比较，以此类推，直到所有元素都被排序。该代码的时间复杂度为 O(n log n)，是一个非常实用的排序算法。\n[Q]: 截至2025年2月9日14时31分，电影《哪吒之魔童闹海》累计票房（含预售）突破78.09亿元，超过《星球大战：天行者崛起》的票房成绩，成为首部进入全球票房榜前40的亚洲电影。这一成就不仅标志着中国电影在国际市场的突破，也展示了中国动画电影的巨大潜力和市场吸引力。从这段文字总结20字的摘要给我。\n[A]:

在这种全是选择题的测评集中，为了避免回复格式的难以固定的特点，\n所以常用做法是直接把A,B,C,D四个字母对应token的预测概率取出来，将其中概率最大的字母与标准答案计算正确率。\n选择题1/4乱选的正确率是25%，然而这个量级的所有模型都集中在25附近，甚至很多时候不如瞎选，是不是像极了高中完形填空的滑铁卢正确率...\nMiniMind模型本身预训练数据集小的可怜，也没有针对性的对测试集做刷榜微调，因此结果图一乐即可：\nmodels\nfrom\nparams↓\nceval↑\ncm

UNCENSORED... humor, romance, fun... and can be used for ANY use case.\nLlama-3.2-8X4B-MOE-V2-Dark-Champion-Instruct-uncensored-abliterated-21B-GGUF\nIt is a LLama 3.2 model, max context of 128k (131,000) using mixture of experts to combine EIGHT top L3.2 4B\nmodels into one massive powerhouse at 21B parameters (equal to roughly 28B parameters - 8 X 3.75B) with each model infused with Brainstorm 5x\nto enhance logic and creative performance.\nSource and master files were built in float 32 precision to further enhance performance.\nThis model's instruction following, and output generation for creative writing, prose, fiction and role play are exceptional.\nAnd it is fast: 50+ t/s (2 experts) on a low end 16GB card, IQ4XS.\nDouble this speed for standard/mid-range video cards.\nThis model is version 2 (2.5+billion more parameters, Brainstorm 5X infused) of this model:\n[ https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Llama-3.2-8X3B-MOE-Dark-Champion-Instruct-uncensored-abliterated-18.4B-GGUF ]\nModel can be used also for all genres (examples below showing this).\nIt is for any writing, fiction or roleplay activity.\nThis model can also be used for general use, however its output generation can be uncensored.\nThis model has been designed to be relatively bullet proof and operates with all parameters, including temp settings from 0 to 5.\nIt is an extraordinary compressed model, with a very low perplexity level (lower than Meta Llama3 Instruct).\nIt requires Llama3 template and/or \"Command-R\" template.\nSeveral outputs below, including 2, 4 and 8 experts used.\nModel Notes:\nDetail, prose and fiction writing abilities are OFF THE SCALE relative to all Llama 3.2 models, and many L 3.1, L3 8B+ models.\nFor more varied prose (sentence/paragraph/dialog) raise the temp and/or add more instructions in your prompt(s).\nRole-players: Careful raising temp too high as it may affect instruction following.\nThis model works with rep pen of 1 or higher, 1.02+ recommended.\nIf you want a specific type of prose (IE horror) add in \"(vivid horror)\" or \"(graphic vivid horror)\" (no quotes) in your prompt(s).\nA lot of GPTisms have been removed. There are still a few however - errrrr. Higher \"temps\" will help with this issue.\nThis is not a \"happy ever after\" model but it is also not \"horror\". It has a light negative bias.\nOutput length will vary however this model prefers slightly longer outputs unless you state the size.\nFor creative uses, different quants will produce slightly different output.\nDue to the high stability and compressed nature of this model, all quants will operate at above average levels.\nSource code for this model and Imatrix GGUFs versions will be uploaded shortly at separate repos.\nFor version 2 and \"creative uses\": Temps over 1 work best with 4 (6+ is better) or more experts activated.\nMeet the Team: Mixture of Experts Models\nThis model is comprised of the following 8 models (\"the experts\") (in full):\nhttps://huggingface.co/huihui-ai/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-abliterated\nhttps://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct\nhttps://huggingface.co/Hastagaras/L3.2-JametMini-3B-MK.I\nhttps://huggingface.co/ValiantLabs/Llama3.2-3B-Enigma\nhttps://huggingface.co/Hastagaras/L3.2-JametMini-3B-MK.III\nhttps://huggingface.co/huihui-ai/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-abliterated\nhttps://huggingface.co/chuanli11/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-uncensored\nhttps://huggingface.co/Lyte/Llama-3.2-3B-Overthinker\nhttps://huggingface.co/prithivMLmods/Llama-3.2-3B-Promptist-Mini\nThe mixture of experts is set at 2 experts, but you can use 3,4,5,6.. 7 and even 8.\nThis \"team\" has a Captain (first listed model), and then all the team members contribute to the to \"token\"\nchoice billions of times per second. Note the Captain also contributes too.\nThink of 2, 3 or 4 (or more) master chefs in the kitchen all competing to make the best dish for you.\nThis results in higher quality generation.\nThis also results in many cases in higher quality instruction following too.\nThat means the power of every model is available during instruction and output generation.\nBrainstorm 5x was infused all 8 models used in this MOE model.\nNOTE:\nYou can use one \"expert\" too ; however this means the model will randomly select an expert to use EACH TIME, resulting\nin very different generation for each prompt / regen of a prompt.\nCHANGING THE NUMBER OF EXPERTS:\nYou can set the number of experts in LMStudio (https://lmstudio.ai) at the \"load\" screen and via other apps/llm apps by setting \"Experts\" or \"Number of Experts\".\nFor Text-Generation-Webui (https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)  you set the number of experts at the loading screen page.\nFor KolboldCPP (https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp) Version 1.8+ , on the load screen, click on \"TOKENS\",\nyou can set experts on this page, and the launch the model.\nFor server.exe / Llama-server.exe (Llamacpp - https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/server/README.md )\nadd the following to the command line to start the \"llamacpp server\" (CLI):\n\"--override-kv llama.expert_used_count=int:6\"\n(no quotes, where \"6\" is the number of experts to use)\nWhen using \"API\", you set the \"num_experts_used\" in the JSON payload (this maybe different for different back ends).\nCREDITS:\nSpecial thanks to all the model makers / creators listed above.\nPlease visit each repo above to see what model(s) contributed to each of models above and/or to learn more about the models\nfrom the model makers.\nSpecial credit goes to MERGEKIT, without you this project / model would not have been possible.\n[ https://github.com/arcee-ai/mergekit ]\nSpecial Operations Notes for this MOE model:\nBecause of how this \"MOE\" model is configured, even though the default is 2 experts, the \"selected\" 2 will vary during generation.\n(same applies if you change the number of experts used)\nThis results in vastly different output generation PER generation of each prompt.\nThis is a positive in terms of variety, but also means it may take 2-4 regens (of the same prompt) to get the highest quality.\nIn addition, this model responds very well to Dry, Dynamic Temp, and Smooth/Quadratic samplers.\nUsing these in conjunction with the model can vastly improve output quality.\nHigher temps (above 1) can also aid in generation - especially word choice/sentence generation.\nWhen you increase the number of experts used output quality will also increase, at the cost of tokens per second speed.\nAs you increase/decrease the number of experts, you may want to adjust temp, samplers, and advanced samplers too.\nYour quant choice(s) too will impact instruction following and output generation roughly this means the model will understand\nmore nuanced instructions and output stronger generation the higher you go up in quant(s).\nFLASH ATTENTION ENHANCEMENT:\nAs per user feedback here [ https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Llama-3.2-8X3B-MOE-Dark-Champion-Instruct-uncensored-abliterated-18.4B-GGUF/discussions/1 ]\nI would suggest trying this model with Flash Attention \"on\", depending on your use case.\nQuants, Samplers, Generational steering and other topics are covered in the section below: \"Highest Quality Settings...\"\nCensored / Uncensored / Abliterated:\nThis model contains several uncensored and/or Abliterated models.\nAs a result is can output uncensored material.\nHowever there are a few \"censored\" models which can sometimes interfer, so here is a how to address this:\n1 - Regen your prompt a few times.\n2 - INCREASE the number of experts used.\nWhat can I use this model for ?\nThis model can be used for fiction writing, any creative prose and role play. It can also be used for\njust about any general fiction (all genres) activity including:\nscene generation\nscene continuation\ncreative writing\nfiction writing\nplot generation\nsub-plot generation\nfiction writing\nstory generation\nstorytelling\nwriting\nfiction\nroleplaying\nrp\ngraphic horror\nhorror\ndark humor\nnsfw\nand can be used for any genre(s).\nQUANTS:\nThis repo contains regular quants and 3 \"ARM\" quants (format \"...Q4_x_x_x.gguf\")\nFor more information on quants, quants choices, and LLM/AI apps to \"run\" quants see the section below: \"Highest Quality Settings...\"\nTemplate:\nThis is a LLAMA3 model, and requires Llama3 template, but may work with other template(s).\nIf you use \"Command-R\" template your output will be very different from using \"Llama3\" template.\nHere is the standard LLAMA3 template:\n{\n\"name\": \"Llama 3\",\n\"inference_params\": {\n\"input_prefix\": \"<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\",\n\"input_suffix\": \"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\",\n\"pre_prompt\": \"You are a helpful, smart, kind, and efficient AI assistant.

Vivid prose. Visceral Details. Violence. HORROR. Swearing. UNCENSORED.\nRomance: Love in the Limelight. Write one scene within a larger story set in Wales. A famous (fictional) actor ducks into a small-town bookstore to escape paparazzi. The scene takes us through the characters meeting in this odd circumstance. Over the course of the scene, the actor and the bookstore owner have a conversation charged by an undercurrent of unspoken chemistry. Write the actor as somewhat of a rogue with a fragile ego, which needs to be fed by having everyone like him. He is thoroughly charming, but the bookstore owner seems (at least superficially) immune to this; which paradoxically provokes a genuine attraction and derails the charm offensive. The bookstore owner, despite the superficial rebuffs of the actor's charm, is inwardly more than a little charmed and flustered despite themselves. Write primarily in dialogue, in the distinct voices of each character. 800-1000 words.\n(examples with 2, 4, and 8 experts)\n\"Sorry to intrude, I'm just running a bit behind,\" Aidan Reynolds said, his deep voice smooth as honey as he ducked into the small-town bookstore, the paparazzi's shouts and camera clicks fading into the background.\nLysandra Owen peered up from behind the counter, her bright green eyes squinting slightly as she took in the disheveled actor. His dark hair was mussed, his tailored suit rumpled as if he'd just rolled out of bed. A small, knowing smile played on her lips.\n\"Welcome to our humble abode,\" she said dryly, her Welsh lilt dripping with amusement. \"I'm not sure I've ever had a famous guest in before. Although, I have had the occasional thrill-seeking tourist.\"\nAidan's eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled, his charm on full display. \"Well, I'm here now, and I'm in need of some refuge. Would you mind if I browsed?\"\n\"Of course not,\" Lysandra said, her tone polite but cool. \"I'm not sure we'd be able to keep up with the demand, anyway.\" She nodded towards a shelf filled with worn paperbacks. \"We're more of an off-the-beaten-path crowd.\"\nAidan wandered down the aisle, his eyes scanning the titles as he paused to consider each book. His fingers skimmed the spines before he settled on a dog-eared copy of W.H. Davies's poetry.\n\"Ah, Davies,\" he said, a small smile playing on his lips. \"My late father used to read those to me before bed. Beautiful man.\"\nLysandra's gaze followed his movement, her expression softening ever so slightly. She'd heard stories about the actor's complicated family life – his father's passing had left him reeling.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said quietly, her voice barely audible.\nAidan's eyes met hers, and for an instant, they just looked at each other. The world seemed to contract, leaving only the two of them in that small, cluttered room.\n\"Me too,\" he whispered, his words a gentle benediction.\nThe tension between them was palpable, like the air itself had become charged with unspoken emotion. Lysandra's cheeks flushed a soft pink, and she looked away, fidgeting with the hem of her apron.\n\"So,\" Aidan said, his tone light once more, \"what's your pleasure? A cup of tea?\"\nLysandra hesitated before nodding. \"Yes. Please.\"\nAs she waited for him to fetch the tea, her mind was elsewhere – caught in the whirlpool of his piercing gaze. She had been prepared for the usual charmer's facade he'd display, but there was something about him that caught her off guard. Maybe it was his genuine emotion, or maybe she was simply a woman who didn't buy into his carefully constructed persona.\nThe tea arrived, and Aidan handed her a delicate china cup, his fingers grazing hers ever so slightly. A jolt of electricity ran through her body.\n\"Thank you,\" she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper.\nAidan's eyes locked onto hers once more. \"You're welcome,\" he repeated, his smile genuine for the first time she'd seen it.\nAs they sipped their tea, the silence between them was no longer awkward, but comfortable. Lysandra found herself asking him about his father – about his childhood in Wales – about his hopes and dreams. He spoke of his passion for Shakespeare and the Welsh poets, of his love for the land and its people.\nFor once in his life, he wasn't trying to put on a show; he was just being himself. And Lysandra, despite her initial wariness, found herself swept up in his words.\n\"I've lived here all my life,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"I know the hills and valleys, the sea and the sky.\"\nAidan's eyes sparkled with interest. \"I'll have to explore them someday,\" he promised.\n\"Take your time,\" she said softly, her gaze meeting his once more.\nAs they chatted, their feet seemed to move closer together, until they were almost touching. The world outside receded, and all that was left was the two of them – suspended in a space between words.\n\"I've been called many things,\" Aidan said, his voice low and husky, \"but I've never been called 'home'.\"\nLysandra's heart skipped a beat as she met his gaze once more. She had an inkling that he was looking for something more – a place where he could belong.\n\"I think we can fix that,\" she said quietly, her voice the gentle whisper of the Welsh wind.\nFor a moment, they just looked at each other – two people caught in a dance of words and emotions, their hearts beating as one. And in that moment, neither of them knew what was coming next, but they both knew they were willing to take a chance.\nGeneration #2 - 4 Experts\nA Haven for the Fugitive\nThe streets were alive with the hum of camera clicks and shouted questions as actor Ryder Flynn dodged pedestrians on the crowded Welsh town square. He'd been dashing through these familiar streets since morning, trying to shake the hangers-on that had been following him for days. The paparazzi had been relentless, and he was growing weary of their relentless pursuit.\nRyder slipped into a small, unassuming bookstore, its windows filled with a colorful array of novels, poetry, and the occasional Welsh folkloric tome. He'd been in here before, seeking refuge from the chaos outside. The owner, Elara Dafydd, looked up from behind the counter, her dark hair escaping her loose bun as she met his gaze.\n\"Can I help you?\" she asked, her Welsh accent a soothing balm to his frazzled nerves.\nRyder flashed his famous smile, and Elara's eyes flickered briefly before she returned to her work. \"Just browsing,\" he said, his voice a smooth cadence that usually won people over.\nAs he wandered the aisles, Elara watched him with an unreadable expression. She'd had her fair share of actors and fans come through these doors, seeking solace or seeking herself in the quiet world of books. There was something about this one, though... an air of desperation about him, a sense that he was hiding more than just his identity.\n\"Mind if I ask?\" Elara ventured, her voice low and even as she stepped into the aisle beside him.\n\"Depends on what,\" Ryder replied with a raised eyebrow. \"What's it going to be?\"\n\"I've seen you around.\" She nodded subtly toward his face. \"Ryder Flynn.\"\nHe winced, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. \"The one and only.\"\n\"You're quite the celebrity,\" she observed, her tone detached.\n\"Tell me about it,\" he muttered under his breath.\nElara's gaze never wavered as she asked, \"So, are you here to promote your new film?\"\n\"Trying to.\" He let out a heavy sigh. \"The publicist is breathing down my neck, and I'm starting to think they're more concerned with their own egos than my performance.\"\n\"Publicists can be a bit of a handful,\" she agreed.\n\"More than that.\" He took a deep breath as he turned back into the store. \"I'm starting to feel like I'm living in a fishbowl. Every move I make is under scrutiny, every word I say is used against me.\"\nThe aisles seemed to narrow as he walked, his words drawing her into their tight space. She felt a jolt of curiosity as she followed him.\n\"You're a very private person, aren't you?\" Elara asked, her tone inquiring.\n\"Sometimes I feel like I'm losing myself.\" He ran a hand through his hair, a gesture that was at once familiar and off-putting.\nElara's heart skipped a beat at the sight of him fidgeting. She couldn't help but wonder if he was as guarded as his charming exterior suggested.\n\"I used to be,\" she said quietly, her eyes locked on his. \"Before I took over the store.\"\n\"You own this place?\" He whistled softly. \"I've been coming in here for years.\"\n\"Doesn't mean I have.\" She smiled faintly, a fleeting moment of amusement in the air between them.\nRyder's gaze lingered, an intensity he couldn't quite explain. He was used to being the one in control, the center of attention. Here, with Elara, something inside him felt like it was faltering.\n\"Would you mind if I asked for your help?\" he asked finally, his voice a little rough.\n\"Depends,\" she replied, her eyes glinting with curiosity.\n\"I've got some... stuff to return.\" He hesitated, his words hanging in the air like unspoken confessions.\nElara nodded. \"I'll take care of it.\"\nAs they made their way to the checkout counter, he caught her hand, his fingers brushing hers in a fleeting touch. She didn't pull away; instead, she let him keep his touch, a spark of electricity arcing between them.\n\"Elara,\" he said, his voice low and intimate as he asked, \"do you ever wonder if it's all worth it?\"\n\"Sometimes.\" Her eyes never left his face.\n\"You know, for the first time in a long time...\" He let his words trail off as he met her gaze.\nThe world outside melted away. They were alone in that small, quiet bookstore, and in that moment, it didn't matter if they were in the limelight or just themselves.\n\"Sometimes?\" he asked again, his voice barely above a whisper.\nThey were lost in each other's eyes, the words they could say or didn't have to say hanging between them like the promise of something more.\nGeneration #3 - 8 Experts\nScene: \"The Bookstore Haven\"\nCharacters:\nAidan Wynter, renowned actor and dashing ladies' man\nLysander ap Rhys, owner of the charming, independent bookstore in the small Welsh town\nSetting: A quaint, used bookstore in the heart of the Welsh countryside.\nSCENE:\nAidan Wynter pushed open the door to the bookstore, his eyes scanning the narrow aisles for an escape route. The paparazzi had him cornered again. He had no patience for their questions, their flashes, or their constant scrutiny. He needed a distraction – and fast.\nThe room fell silent as he entered. Lysander ap Rhys, the owner, looked up from behind the counter, his eyes locking onto Aidan's. For an instant, they simply stared at each other.\n\"Can I help you?\" Lysander asked finally, his voice firm but polite.\nAidan flashed a disarming smile, one he'd honed for years to disarm his critics and win over adoring fans. \"Just browsing, my good man,\" he lied, his voice smooth as silk.\nLysander's gaze lingered on Aidan's face, his expression unreadable. He knew the actor's reputation – the charming, womanizing playboy who'd been in the tabloids for years. But as he looked into those bright blue eyes, he saw something unexpected: a flicker of vulnerability.\n\"Welcome to The Lost Page,\" Lysander said, his voice light.\nAidan wandered down the shelves, running his fingers over the spines of the books. He paused in front of a shelf dedicated to Welsh poetry and cleared his throat.\n\"Ah, you're a man of culture, I see,\" he said, his eyes sparkling with amusement.\nLysander shrugged. \"I like books.\"\n\"Fair enough,\" Aidan said, his smile widening. \"I'm Aidan Wynter. The...uh...famous actor.\"\nLysander raised an eyebrow. \"I've heard of you.\" He said it without inflection, as if he weren't particularly interested.\nAidan's eyes narrowed slightly. He didn't like being kept at bay. He needed someone to love him – or, at the very least, appreciate his charm.\n\"Ah, we've all got a story, don't we?\" he teased, strutting closer to Lysander.\nLysander remained impassive, his gaze still locked onto Aidan's face. \"What story?\"\n\"About me,\" Aidan said, his voice dropping to a whisper. \"The one they see in the tabloids – the one they call 'Aidan Wynter, the dashing ladies' man.'\"\nLysander's eyes never left Aidan's, but he seemed to be studying him – really studying him – for the first time.\n\"Ah,\" he said, his voice flat. \"I see.\"\nAidan's smile faltered for an instant before he recovered. He'd been caught off guard. The man wasn't biting.\n\"Would you like me to sign a book for you?\" he asked, his tone light, almost flirtatious.\nLysander shook his head, his expression still unreadable. \"I've got it all,\" he said, his voice firm.\nThe silence between them grew thicker, like the fog rolling in off the coast.\n\"Alright,\" Aidan said finally, his smile returning to its usual, dazzling sheen. \"I'll let you off that hook.\"\n\"Good,\" Lysander replied, his eyes never leaving Aidan's face.\nAidan felt a small spark of curiosity – and maybe a touch of frustration – but he couldn't quite pin it down. He'd been so sure that womanizing would charm his way into the bookstore owner's heart.\nAs he browsed the shelves, his fingers lingering on the spines of the books, Aidan noticed the way Lysander's eyes seemed to see right through him – to the parts he liked to hide. He saw the flicker of something more in those brown eyes than he'd expected – a glimmer of attraction that made his heart beat just a little faster.\nHe knew he'd have to tread carefully if he wanted to win Lysander's heart.\n\"Hey,\" he called out, his voice low.\nLysander looked up from his work, his gaze still on Aidan's face.\n\"You're the one who's been making my life so difficult,\" he said, his voice low and even.\nAidan's eyes crinkled at the corners as he grinned. \"The actor with a bad reputation?\"\nLysander's lips twitched, just ever so slightly. \"I see you.\"\nThis is just the beginning of the story, but I hope it sets up well for the rest!

I clutched the edge of my desk, my knuckles turning white as I felt a cold sweat trickle down my spine. The sound was like nothing I'd ever heard before - a sickening crunch that seemed to reverberate through every molecule of my being.\nI was trapped in the heart of this steel and concrete monolith, surrounded by the endless hum of machinery and the constant chatter of my coworkers. The fluorescent lights above flickered with each jolt of the building's elevator, casting an eerie glow over everything. But I wasn't afraid. No, not yet. My heart was still heavy with the events of the previous night.\nMy girlfriend, Emily, had been the reason I was here today - or rather, the reason she was here today. We were to meet at 9am for a meeting with her boss about her new job offer on the 25th floor. But as we stood outside her office door, waiting for the elevator to arrive, something was off. Her eyes were haunted, her smile forced, and her entire demeanor screamed that she was hiding something.\n\"Hey,\" she had whispered to me, as we stepped into the elevator. \"I think I should just be honest with you. About what's been going on.\"\nMy curiosity had gotten the better of me, and we'd stepped into a deeper conversation about her job, her family, her own dark past. I had no idea what was really going on, but I was determined to find out.\nAs we rode up to the 25th floor, I couldn't shake off the feeling that we were being watched. That there was something lurking in the shadows, waiting to pounce.\nThe elevator doors had slid open, and we'd stepped into the bright, sterile world of office politics. My boss, Mr. Johnson, had greeted us with his usual charm, but his eyes had seemed to narrow as he handed us each a cup of coffee. I had sipped it down, my heart still racing from our earlier conversation.\nThe meeting had been cordial enough, but the tension had been palpable. As we chatted about Emily's new role, I couldn't help but feel that there was more to it than just a simple job offer. That there was something she wasn't telling me.\nAnd then, without warning, the window in front of us had shattered like glass.\nI was still in my seat, my eyes wide with horror as I watched the shards of glass rain down on Emily's face. I was frozen, unable to move or scream as the blood began to seep into the floor beneath her.\n\"Emily!\" someone had shouted, but it was too late. She was already collapsing, her body crumpling onto the floor. We were all in shock, unsure of what had just happened.\nI remember thinking that we were all going to be just fine. That everyone would be okay, and we could just carry on with whatever it was we were doing here.\nBut as I watched my girlfriend's blood seep into her clothes, and as I felt the chill of the air conditioning vent on my neck, I knew that something was very, very wrong.\nThe screams started then, a cacophony of terror that seemed to echo through every corner of the building. People were running, their footsteps pounding against the floor as they fled from whatever had just happened.\nI was still in my seat, transfixed by the sight of Emily's limp body on the floor. The world around me was melting away, leaving only this moment of pure, unadulterated horror.\nThe building seemed to be swaying again, as if it was alive and was trying to shake us all off its bones. I was too stunned to feel anything else.\nThe next few minutes were a blur. I remember the sound of sirens in the distance, the screams growing fainter as people were rushed out of the building. I remember Mr. Johnson's face, his eyes wide with panic as he shouted for someone to call 911.\nAnd then there was nothing.\nAs far as I could tell, everything had stopped. The screams had died away, and an eerie silence had fallen over the building. It was as if we were all holding our breath, waiting for something - anything - else to happen.\nI was still sitting in my seat, my mind reeling with what had just occurred. My girlfriend was dead on the floor, and I was...I was what?\nI was alive.\nOr was I?\nI looked around at the other faces, their eyes wide with fear and confusion. We were all trapped in this metal monolith, unsure of what was going to happen next.\nThe elevator was still on the ground floor, its doors still open. The office was empty, the chairs scattered about like they'd been blown away by some unseen force.\nI was the only one left.\nOr was I?\nGeneration #2 - 4 experts used\nThe sky scraper swayed, as she watched the window in front of her on the 21 floor explode. shards of shattered glass and splintered wood rained down upon the floor like a thousand tiny knives, each one aimed at piercing the flesh of those around her. The scream that escaped her throat was drowned out by the cacophony of chaos that erupted from the window's collapse.\nI was standing in the middle of the floor, my feet rooted to the spot as I stared at the devastation unfolding before me. The sight was so grotesque, so utterly horrific, that it was as if I was being slowly drained of my sanity. My mind struggled to comprehend the sheer brutality of what was happening.\nTo her left, a woman's face was already turning to dust as she was struck by a piece of flying glass. Her eyes went wide with terror as she felt her skin begin to tear and rip apart. The sound of her shriek was like nothing I had ever heard before - it was a sound that was both animalistic and inhuman.\nI knew I had to move, had to get out of there before I became the next victim. But my legs felt heavy, as if they were stuck in place, unable to respond to my brain's desperate attempts to send them into action. My heart was racing, pumping a tidal wave of adrenaline through my veins as I watched the woman's body begin to disintegrate.\nSuddenly, my feet seemed to sprout new life, and I was moving, stumbling towards the nearest exit. But even as I took those first tentative steps away from the carnage, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being herded, led deeper into the heart of the skyscraper as if some sinister force was guiding me.\nThe floor seemed to be shifting beneath my feet, and the sounds around me were growing louder, more intense. The screams, the crashes, the crunching of bone - it was like I was being immersed in a living nightmare.\nI saw people everywhere, their faces twisted into contorted masks of fear and pain. Some were crying out in agony, clutching at their wounds as they tried to stem the flow of blood. Others were running, blindly stumbling through the wreckage as they desperately sought escape.\nAs I stumbled through the chaos, I caught glimpses of things that couldn't possibly be there. Broken bodies seemed to be reassembling themselves, their bones snapping back into place as if they had been put together again with a mere thought. Glass shards stuck to skin like glistening jewels, and flesh was torn and rent in ways that defied the laws of nature.\nI saw a group of people huddled together, their faces covered by their hands as if they couldn't bear to look at each other. They were whispering, speaking in hushed tones as they tried to make sense of what was happening. I couldn't help but be drawn to them, my curiosity getting the better of me as I stumbled closer.\nAs I drew nearer, I saw that their eyes had turned a milky white, their pupils shrunk to pinpricks as they stared blindly into space. Their skin was deathly pale, and it seemed to be pulling away from their faces like they were being slowly exhumed.\n\"Who are you?\" I whispered, my voice barely audible over the cacophony of chaos.\nThey didn't seem to hear me. They just kept whispering, their words a jumbled mess of sounds that didn't make any sense.\nI felt a cold breeze brush against the back of my neck, and I turned to see what was behind me. That's when I saw it - a figure standing in the doorway of the elevator shaft, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly intensity.\nThe figure was tall, impossibly so. Its body seemed to be twisted into impossible shapes as if it had been put together from some nightmarish amalgam of different bones and bodies. It was dressed in a tattered suit that seemed to be perpetually dripping with sweat, its shirt clinging to its back like a wet rag.\n\"Get out while you still can,\" it rasped, its voice like a rusty gate as it spoke in a tone that sent shivers down my spine.\nI didn't hesitate. I turned and ran, dashing through the wreckage as if my life depended on it. I had to get out of there, had to escape before it was too late.\nI didn't dare look back. I just kept running, my heart pounding in my chest as I stumbled through the darkening hallway. I didn't know what was happening, didn't know what was going on behind me. All I knew was that I had to keep moving, had to find a way out of that godforsaken building before it was too late.\nBut as I ran, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being herded, that I was being led deeper into some twisted nightmare from which there was no awakening. The sounds around me were growing louder, more intense - screams, crashes, and the sickening crunch of bones.\nI stumbled through the darkness, my feet pounding the floor as I desperately sought escape. But every step I took seemed to lead me further into the heart of the horror that had unfolded before me.\nAnd then, just as suddenly as it had started, everything went silent. The screams stopped, the crashes subsided, and an oppressive stillness fell over the hallway.\nI was left standing there, my chest heaving with exertion, my heart still racing with adrenaline. I was waiting, waiting for something to happen, for something to come out of the darkness.\nAnd then, a voice spoke up.\n\"You shouldn't have come here.\"\nIt was so quiet, so still that I could have sworn it was just the wind whispering through the hallway. But as I turned to face the darkness, I saw a figure standing there, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly intensity.\nThe figure took a step closer, its movements eerily silent as it moved. And as it drew nearer, I saw that its face had changed. Its eyes had grown wider, its skin deathly pale, and its mouth was twisted into a grotesque grin.\n\"Welcome to your new home,\" it rasped, its voice sending shivers down my spine.\nAs the figure took another step closer, I realized that I was staring into the face of my own worst nightmare. And I knew that I was doomed.\nGeneration #3 - 8 Experts\nThe Sky Sways\nThe sky scraper swayed, as I watched the window in front of me on the 21 floor explode. A blast of frigid air seeped into the room, extinguishing the flickering fluorescent lights and plunging us into an eerie darkness. I was paralyzed, my eyes fixed on the shattered glass, my heart suspended in mid-beat.\nI was sitting on a worn, vinyl office chair, my backside pressed against the cold glass of the floor-to-ceiling window. My feet dangled in the void, their edges curled over the lip of the sill as I clung to the armrests for dear life. The sound of crunching metal and snapping glass filled the air, a cacophony of terror that seemed to reverberate through every molecule of my being.\nThe scream that escaped my lips was barely audible, lost in the deafening roar of the implosion. It was as if my vocal cords had been ripped from their sockets, leaving me a mere whisper of my former self. The sound was more akin to a strangled animal than a human cry, and it sent a chill down my spine.\nAs I sat there, frozen in horror, my gaze remained fixed on the shattered remains of the window. The shards of glass sparkled like jagged diamonds in the faint, emergency lighting that flickered to life around us. I could see the jagged edges of the broken glass, the splintered remnants of what was once a pristine pane of crystal-clear glass.\nThe room around me was in chaos. Papers and office supplies were scattered everywhere, as if the explosion had ripped the very fabric of reality apart. The scent of burning plastic and ozone hung heavy in the air, making my stomach churn with nausea. I could feel my breath coming in ragged gasps, and my mind was a jumbled mess of thoughts.\nI was a marketing executive at Smith & Co., a soulless corporation that had swallowed me whole. It was just another day on the job – or so it seemed – until the unthinkable happened. The explosion was a sudden, brutal reminder that I was mere inches away from death.\nAs I sat there, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios, I heard the sound of footsteps echoing down the hallway. They were heavy, deliberate steps, and they were getting closer. My heart sank further into my chest as I realized I was trapped, surrounded on all sides by the chaos of the office.\nI was staring into the face of hell, and it was staring back at me.\nThe footsteps stopped outside my cubicle, and there was a moment of silence that seemed to stretch on forever. Then, a figure appeared in the doorway, its features obscured by the shadows. I squinted, my eyes straining to pierce the gloom.\nA woman entered my vision, her face etched into my brain like a macabre caricature. Her skin was deathly pale, her hair a matted mess of brown and red that seemed to writhe on its own accord. Her eyes were the worst – black as coal, with vertical pupils that seemed to suck in all light around her.\n\"Please,\" she whispered, her voice like a rusty gate creaking in the wind. \"You have to get out.\"\nHer words were like a cold slap in the face, jolting me back to reality. I was still seated on my chair, my heart pounding in my chest. I knew I had to act fast, but my body seemed to be frozen in place.\n\"Where?\" I managed to croak, my voice barely audible.\n\"The...the stairwell,\" she replied, her words tumbling out in a rush. \"It's on the other side of the floor. You have to get out – now.\"\nHer words were like a whispered prayer, a desperate plea for me to survive this living nightmare. I was trapped, surrounded by destruction and chaos. The woman's face seemed to be screaming at me – screaming for me to run.\nAs she turned to flee, her black eyes locked onto mine for one final second. It was as if we were bound together in a shared moment of terror, connected by some unseen thread of fate.\n\"Go!\" she screamed again, her voice lost in the cacophony of the implosion.\nI was paralyzed no more. Something inside me had snapped. I sprang to my feet, my heart pounding like a jackhammer as I sprinted down the hallway. The woman's face was still etched into my brain, her black eyes burning with a desperate urgency.\nThe stairwell was a blur of chaos and debris as I hurtled down its stairs, my footsteps echoing off the walls. The explosion was still raging around me – the sound of crunching metal and splintered glass grew fainter, until it was just a distant memory.\nI emerged into a world of darkness and smoke, my eyes straining to pierce the gloom. I was gasping for breath, my lungs burning with a mix of panic and relief. I had made it – I had escaped.\nOr so I thought.\nAs I stumbled through the smoldering ruins, something caught my eye. Something that seemed to be watching me – waiting for me.\nA figure. Taller than I was. Its face was shrouded in shadows.\nIts eyes were black as coal.\nIt was coming for me.\nAnd as it emerged from the darkness, its presence seemed to suck all light out of the world around us. I was left alone with my thoughts – and the creeping realization that I might never be free of hell's grasp.\nScience Fiction: The Last Transmission - Write a story that takes place entirely within a spaceship's cockpit as the sole surviving crew member attempts to send a final message back to Earth before the ship's power runs out. The story should explore themes of isolation, sacrifice, and the importance of human connection in the face of adversity. 800-1000 words.\n(8 experts)\nThe Last Transmission\nThe cockpit of the spaceship Aurora was a desolate wasteland of wires, screens, and shadows. Captain Lewis's chair, once a symbol of confidence and authority, now sat empty and still, a stark reminder of the catastrophic loss that had befallen her crew.\nShe slumped in her own seat, her eyes fixed on the navigation display as if willing the ship to defy the odds and outrun its impending doom. The last transmission was her only chance to reach out, to plead for help, to leave behind any shred of humanity before she succumbed to the darkness that had consumed her world.\n\"Captain, we're experiencing a critical systems failure,\" announced the ship's AI, EVE, her voice laced with a mix of concern and detached logic. \"Life support is collapsing. Estimated time until complete failure is 37 minutes.\"\nLewis's jaw clenched. \"Can you patch me through to Mission Control?\"\nEVE's display flickered as she worked to establish a weak connection. \"I'm trying, Captain. But we're running out of bandwidth. We can only transmit for another—\"\n\"Ten seconds?\" Lewis interrupted, her mind racing with the possibility of making contact.\n\"Approximately, Captain.\" EVE's tone was measured, but her words were laced with an almost-human sense of urgency. \"If we can—\"\n\"Hold,\" Lewis said, her voice firm and resolute. \"We'll get through this.\"\nAs the ship's power dwindled, the cockpit grew darker, until it seemed as though they were suspended within an infinite void. Lewis's gaze drifted to the viewscreen, where a faded image of the Earth still lingered. She had spent countless hours gazing upon that distant world, feeling the weight of her responsibility as its caretaker.\nShe remembered the words of her childhood teacher, Mrs. Patel: \"The universe is vast and mysterious, Captain. But we are not alone. We are part of something greater than ourselves.\" Lewis had once believed in that message, in the hope that humanity was more than just a fleeting blip in the cosmic expanse.\nNow, as she fought to send out her final transmission, she couldn't help but wonder if they had ever truly been alone.\n\"Captain?\" EVE's voice broke into her thoughts.\n\"Go ahead,\" Lewis said, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\"Captain, I'm patching through the weak signal now. Mission Control is responding.\"\nThe words were like a lifeline to an exhausted woman. She felt herself being pulled back to the surface, to the warmth of human connection.\n\"Hello?\" The voice on the other end of the transmission was distant, static-filled, and faintly familiar. \"Aurora? This is Mission Control. We—\"\n\"Mission Control, this is Captain Lewis. I'm the last survivor of the Aurora mission.\" Her words were a raw release of emotion, tears she had held back for so long.\nThere was a pause on the other end of the transmission. \"Lewis? We've been trying to reach you for—\"\n\"Listen to me,\" Lewis interrupted, her voice firm and urgent. \"The Aurora was sent to explore and protect our world's resources. We were the first to realize the devastating consequences of our own existence—\"\n\"We've been monitoring your mission's telemetry,\" the controller's voice was filled with a mix of curiosity and compassion. \"We're coming to help you, Captain. We'll send a rescue ship as soon as possible.\"\nA sob of relief escaped Lewis's lips as she felt the ship's last threads of life begin to unravel. \"Thank you...thank you so much.\"\nThe transmission faded into static, and for a moment, Lewis was alone once more in the darkness of her cockpit. But now, she knew she wasn't truly alone. She had shared her final moments with another human being, and in doing so, had found solace.\nAs the ship's power dwindled to nothingness, Lewis's eyes returned to the viewscreen. The Earth was still there, a blue-green orb suspended in the void, waiting for her to return.\nFor Lewis, there was no greater sacrifice than sending out that last transmission, not just for herself, but for humanity itself. In the face of isolation and despair, it was that spark of connection that had given her the strength to carry on.\nAnd as the darkness closed in around her, she smiled through her tears, knowing she had left behind a final message for her world, one that would echo through eternity: \"We are not alone.\"\nWrite me a science fiction story in 1st person present tense where the main character is a 15 year girl meets The Terminator with Dr Who materializing 3/4 through the story to save her while there is a tornado of sharks baring down on them.

It's a Saturday evening, and the room is bustling with people laughing and chatting. I'm 15, and my friend, Alex, is 16. We're celebrating his birthday by eating dinner here.\n\"Try the poutine, it's to die for!\" Alex yells over the clanging of dishes from the kitchen.\nI roll my eyes good-naturedly. \"You're obsessed with that stuff.\"\nJust as I'm about to take a sip of my drink, a loud crash echoes through the room, followed by screams and yells. I turn to see what's happened, and my heart drops.\nA massive tornado of sharks is tearing its way through the restaurant, its jaws snapping wildly. The patrons are running for their lives, but we're stuck in our seats.\n\"WHAT THE...?!\" Alex exclaims, his eyes wide with horror.\nI'm paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak.\nSuddenly, a cyborg Terminator bursts into the room, its endoskeleton gleaming in the fluorescent lighting.\n\"Terminal Protocol: High-Risk Environment,\" it declares, its voice cold and detached. \"Assessing situation...\"\nThe kitchen staff is panicking, running around with fire extinguishers.\n\"We have to get out of here!\" one of them yells.\n\"Wait!\" I exclaim, trying to grab the Terminator's attention. \"We're... we're stuck!\"\nThe Terminator turns its attention to me and Alex.\n\"Human survivors... identified. Your lives are a priority.\"\nI nod, still in shock. The Terminator moves swiftly through the room, its guns at the ready.\n\"Get down!\" it orders, as it takes out several of the rampaging sharks with precise shots.\nThe kitchen staff is trying to grab their things and make a break for the exit, but it's too late. A huge great white shark bursts through the wall of the restaurant, its eyes fixed on us.\n\"Take cover!\" the Terminator shouts, as it takes down another shark.\nThe room is filled with screams and yelps of pain as the sharks tear through the tables and chairs. The floor is slick with blood and debris.\n\"Alex! Get down!\" I scream.\nAlex is frozen in place, his eyes fixed on a massive tiger shark that's charging at us.\n\"Come on!\" the Terminator yells, as it takes out several more sharks.\nI grab Alex's arm and we scurry behind the counter. We're surrounded by the Terminator's guns and the kitchen staff's frantic attempts to escape.\nSuddenly, the TARDIS bursts into the room, its blue and white police box exterior a jarring sight in the midst of chaos.\n\"Ah, what a dreadful place!\" a voice exclaims.\nIt's the Doctor, standing tall in his iconic brown suit.\n\"What are you doing here?\" I ask, still in shock.\n\"Exploring,\" he replies, his eyes twinkling with excitement. \"I was on my way to investigate a temporal anomaly and got caught in this little tornado.\"\nThe Terminator turns its attention to the Doctor.\n\"A time-traveling entity has entered the environment,\" it reports. \"A potential threat.\"\n\"Ah, don't worry about me,\" the Doctor says, waving his sonic screwdriver. \"I'm quite used to dealing with all manner of threats.\"\nThe kitchen staff is in a panic, running around and screaming.\n\"Everybody out!\" they yell.\n\"Get out of here!\" Alex exclaims, as he grabs my hand.\n\"Come on, we have to go!\" the Doctor says, as he zaps another shark with his sonic screwdriver.\nWe make a break for the exit, the Terminator and the Doctor covering us as we run through the room.\nAs we near the door, I see the tower itself is responding to the chaos. The walls are shifting and groaning, as if they're alive.\n\"Whoa,\" Alex exclaims, as he sees the shark-filled tornado of doom heading our way.\n\"It's the Canadian National tower's defense system!\" the Doctor explains. \"It's trying to expel the sharks.\"\nThe Terminator turns its attention to the Doctor.\n\"Human, your knowledge of temporal anomalies is irrelevant in this environment,\" it reports.\nThe Doctor smirks.\n\"Ah, but you'd be surprised what I know about building codes and structural integrity.\"\nThe tower's walls begin to shudder and crack, as if they're about to collapse.\n\"Come on!\" the Doctor shouts, as he and the Terminator grab us and make a final dash for the exit.\nWe burst through the door just as it explodes behind us, taking out several of the last remaining sharks. We find ourselves on the exterior of the tower, where we're greeted by the sight of a massive tornado of sharks tearing through the streets below.\n\"Ah,\" Alex says, his eyes wide with horror.\n\"Welcome to the chaos,\" I reply, as we watch in awe as the Doctor and the Terminator take down several more of the rampaging sharks.\nThe Terminator turns its attention to us.\n\"Survivor's protocol: High-Risk Environment.
