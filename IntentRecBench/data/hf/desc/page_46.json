    "Nanbeige/Nanbeige4-3B-Thinking-2510": "1. Introduction\n2. Model Summary\n3. Model Performance\n4. Quickstart\n5. Limitations\n6. Citation\n7. Contact\n1. Introduction\nNanbeige4-3B-Thinking is a 3B-parameter reasoning model within the fourth-generation Nanbeige LLM family.\nIt showcases that even compact models can achieve advanced reasoning abilities through continuous enhancements in data quality and training methodologies.\nTo support research and technological advancement in the open-source community, we have open-sourced the Nanbeige4-3B-Thinking model together with its technical methodology.\n2. Model Summary\nPre-Training\nWe constructed a comprehensive 23T-tokens training corpus from web texts, books, code, and papers, meticulously filtered through a hybrid strategy of tagging-based scoring and retrieval-based recalling.\nThis foundation was then augmented with knowledge-dense and reasoning-intensive synthetic data, including Q&A pairs, textbooks, and Long-COTs, which significantly benefited the downstream task performance.\nWe designed an innovative FG-WSD (Fine-Grained Warmup-Stable-Decay) training scheduler, meticulously refining the conventional WSD approach.\nThis scheduler was implemented with a fine-grained, quality-progressive data curriculum, dividing the Stable stage into multiple phases with progressively improved data mixtures. Compared to the vanilla WSD, our method achieved notable performance gains. During the Decay stage, we increased the proportion of math, code, synthetic QA, and synthetic Long-COT data to further enhance reasoning capabilities.\nStage\nTraining Tokens\nLearning Rate\nWarmup Stage\n0.1T\n0 ——> 4.5e-4\nDiversity-Enriched Stable Stage\n12.4T\nConstant 4.5e-4\nHigh-Quality Stable Stage\n6.5T\nConstant 4.5e-4\nDecay and Long-Context Stage\n4T\n4.5e-4 ——> 1.5e-6\nPost-Training\nSFT phase. We constructed a collection of over 30 million high-quality Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) samples to support multi-stage curriculum learning.\nBy integrating both rule-based and model-based verification methods, we not only ensured sample accuracy but also enhanced the comprehensiveness and instructional value of each training example compared to alternative candidates.\nThis rich diversity in instructions and high response quality equipped the model to achieve outstanding performance across a variety of benchmarks.\nDistill. Following SFT, we employed the Nanbeige flagship reasoning model as the teacher model to distill the Nanbeige4-3B-Thinking model, and further enhanced the performance.\nWe observed that on-policy distillation provides greater benefits for mathematical reasoning tasks, while off-policy distillation is more effective for general tasks such as human-preference alignment.\nRL phase. We then advanced to a multi-stage, on-policy reinforcement learning phase.\nThis approach leverages verifiable rewards to enhance reasoning capability and a preference reward model to improve alignment, utilizing a carefully filtered blend of real-world and synthetic data calibrated for appropriate difficulty.\n3. Model Performance\nFor model performance comparison, we benchmark our model against recent reasoning LLMs from the Qwen3 series.\nAll models are evaluated under identical configurations to ensure fairness.\nThe results show that our model outperforms the baselines across a range of mainstream benchmarks, including math, science, creative writing, tool use, and human preference alignment.\nModel\nAIME24\nAIME25\nGPQA\nSuper-GPQA\nScience-QA\nWriting-Bench\nBFCL-V4-Agentic\nArena-hard2\nQwen3-8B-Thinking-2504\n76.0\n67.3\n62.0\n39.1\n24.8\n74.8\n14.4\n26.4\nQwen3-14B-Thinking-2504\n79.3\n70.4\n64.0\n46.8\n23.2\n77.2\n17.0\n40.5\nQwen3-4B-Thinking-2507\n83.3\n81.3\n67.2\n46.7\n24.4\n84.3\n14.3\n37.7\nNanbeige4-3B-Thinking-2510\n87.5\n81.7\n77.2\n51.4\n26.0\n85.5\n17.2\n42.9\n4.

Limitations\nWhile we place great emphasis on the safety of the model during the training process, striving to ensure that its outputs align with ethical and legal requirements, it may not completely avoid generating unexpected outputs due to the model's size and probabilistic nature. These outputs may include harmful content such as bias or discrimination. Please don't propagate such content. We do not assume any responsibility for the consequences resulting from the dissemination of inappropriate information.\n6.

This enables emergent meta-reasoning, recursive planning, and adaptive self-correction — a new standard in interpretability and coherence.\n⚙️ Key Features\n🧩 1T Total | 50B Active MoE Design: Trillion-parameter scale with sparse activation for exceptional throughput efficiency.\n🧠 Evo-CoT Training: Evolutionary chain-of-thought reinforcement — model learns to reason about its own reasoning.\n📚 20T+ Token Corpus: Pre-trained on a curated, reasoning-dense dataset spanning code, math, science, multilingual text, and human reasoning.\n⏱️ 128K Context Window: Long-context comprehension for entire projects, books, or datasets.\n🧮 Reasoning-Optimized Objective: Curriculum emphasizing precision in long-form logic and mathematical reasoning.\n🧩 Cross-Domain Instruction Tuning: Fine-tuned for professional reasoning, code synthesis, mathematics, and complex dialogue.\n📊 Evaluation\nOpenModel-1T-A50B-Instruct was evaluated against both open-source and closed-source state-of-the-art models, including:\nDeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus\nKimi-K2-Instruct-0905\nGPT-5-main (API)\nGemini-2.5-Pro (API)\n🧩 Benchmark Results\nDomain\nBenchmark\nOpenModel-1T-A50B-Instruct\nSOTA Comparison\nMathematics (Competition-Level)\nAIME-25\nExtended Pareto frontier of reasoning length vs. accuracy\n✓ Superior\nProfessional Math\nMATH-500\nOutperforms by +6.2% over DeepSeek-V3.1\n✓ Superior\nLogical Reasoning\nARC-C / GPQA\nDemonstrates state-of-the-art coherence and low hallucination rate\n✓ Superior\nCode Generation\nHumanEval+ / MBPP+\nOutperforms Kimi-K2-Instruct by ~8% pass@1\n✓ Superior\nGeneral Dialogue\nMT-Bench\nComparable to GPT-5-main; improved factual grounding\n✓ On Par / Better in Logic Depth\n🧬 Design Philosophy\nOpenModel-1T was built not just to scale intelligence, but to evolve it.\nThe Evo-CoT process simulates intellectual growth — allowing reasoning pathways to mutate, recombine, and self-select under performance feedback, akin to neural evolution.\nThis architecture fuses cognitive diversity with efficiency, enabling the model to “think deeper, not longer.”\n🧬 Pre-Training at Trillion Scale\nThe OpenModel architecture was engineered for trillion-scale efficiency — ensuring stability and scalability across 1e25–1e26 FLOPs of compute.\nArchitectural Innovations\n⚙️ 1 T total / 50 B active parameters with 1/32 MoE activation ratio\n🧩 MTP Layers – enhanced compositional reasoning\n🚀 Aux-loss-free, sigmoid-scoring expert routing with zero-mean updates\n🧠 QK Normalization – fully stable convergence at scale\n💡 Applications\nAutonomous code generation and debugging\nAI-assisted scientific research\nComplex data analytics and mathematical modeling\nMulti-agent collaboration and orchestration\nEducational tutoring and theorem proving\n🛡️ Responsible AI\nOpenModel-1T was trained with strict filtering of unsafe, biased, or synthetic low-fidelity data.\nSafety layers include prompt-level moderation, reasoning self-checks, and toxicity filters.\nThe model does not produce or endorse harmful, biased, or illegal content.\n📦 Technical Specs\nSpecification\nDetail\nTotal Parameters\n1 Trillion\nActive Parameters\n50 Billion\nArchitecture\nTransformer-MoE with Evo-CoT\nTraining Tokens\n20+ Trillion\nContext Length\n128K\nPrecision\nFP8 / BF16 hybrid\nLicense\nApache-2.0 with AI-Responsible Use Addendum\n🧭 Citation\nIf you use OpenModel-1T in your research or products, please cite:\n@misc{thenexthub-openmodel-1t-a50b,\ntitle={OpenModel-1T-A50B-Instruct: Open Source, Trillion-Scale MoE Model with Evolutionary Chain-of-Thought},\nauthor={NeXTHub},\nyear={2025},\nhowpublished={\\url{https://huggingface.co/thenexthub/OpenModel-1T-A50B-Instruct}},\n}",
