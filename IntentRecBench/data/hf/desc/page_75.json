The Llama 3 instruction tuned models are optimized for dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source chat models on common industry benchmarks. Further, in developing these models, we took great care to optimize helpfulness and safety.\nModel developers Meta\nVariations Llama 3 comes in two sizes — 8B and 70B parameters — in pre-trained and instruction tuned variants.\nInput Models input text only.\nOutput Models generate text and code only.\nModel Architecture Llama 3 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\nTraining Data\nParams\nContext length\nGQA\nToken count\nKnowledge cutoff\nLlama 3\nA new mix of publicly available online data.\n8B\n8k\nYes\n15T+\nMarch, 2023\n70B\n8k\nYes\nDecember, 2023\nLlama 3 family of models. Token counts refer to pretraining data only. Both the 8 and 70B versions use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\nModel Release Date April 18, 2024.\nStatus This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\nLicense A custom commercial license is available at: https://llama.meta.com/llama3/license\nWhere to send questions or comments about the model Instructions on how to provide feedback or comments on the model can be found in the model README. For more technical information about generation parameters and recipes for how to use Llama 3 in applications, please go here.\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases Llama 3 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Instruction tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\nOut-of-scope Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3 Community License. Use in languages other than English**.\n**Note: Developers may fine-tune Llama 3 models for languages beyond English provided they comply with the Llama 3 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy.\nHow to use\nThis repository contains two versions of Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct, for use with transformers and with the original llama3 codebase.\nUse with transformers\nSee the snippet below for usage with Transformers:\nimport transformers\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct\"\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n\"text-generation\",\nmodel=model_id,\nmodel_kwargs={\"torch_dtype\": torch.bfloat16},\ndevice=\"auto\",\n)\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak!\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who are you?\"},\n]\nprompt = pipeline.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True\n)\nterminators = [\npipeline.tokenizer.eos_token_id,\npipeline.tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(\"<|eot_id|>\")\n]\noutputs = pipeline(\nprompt,\nmax_new_tokens=256,\neos_token_id=terminators,\ndo_sample=True,\ntemperature=0.6,\ntop_p=0.9,\n)\nprint(outputs[0][\"generated_text\"][len(prompt):])\nUse with llama3\nPlease, follow the instructions in the repository.\nTo download Original checkpoints, see the example command below leveraging huggingface-cli:\nhuggingface-cli download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct --include \"original/*\" --local-dir Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct\nFor Hugging Face support, we recommend using transformers or TGI, but a similar command works.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research SuperCluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\nCarbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 7.7M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type H100-80GB (TDP of 700W). Estimated total emissions were 2290 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\nTime (GPU hours)\nPower Consumption (W)\nCarbon Emitted(tCO2eq)\nLlama 3 8B\n1.3M\n700\n390\nLlama 3 70B\n6.4M\n700\n1900\nTotal\n7.7M\n2290\nCO2 emissions during pre-training. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview Llama 3 was pretrained on over 15 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over 10M human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\nData Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of March 2023 for the 7B and December 2023 for the 70B models respectively.\nBenchmarks\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 3 models on standard automatic benchmarks. For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.

We are committed to Responsible AI development and took a series of steps to limit misuse and harm and support the open source community.\nFoundation models are widely capable technologies that are built to be used for a diverse range of applications. They are not designed to meet every developer preference on safety levels for all use cases, out-of-the-box, as those by their nature will differ across different applications.\nRather, responsible LLM-application deployment is achieved by implementing a series of safety best practices throughout the development of such applications, from the model pre-training, fine-tuning and the deployment of systems composed of safeguards to tailor the safety needs specifically to the use case and audience.\nAs part of the Llama 3 release, we updated our Responsible Use Guide to outline the steps and best practices for developers to implement model and system level safety for their application. We also provide a set of resources including Meta Llama Guard 2 and Code Shield safeguards. These tools have proven to drastically reduce residual risks of LLM Systems, while maintaining a high level of helpfulness. We encourage developers to tune and deploy these safeguards according to their needs and we provide a reference implementation to get you started.\nLlama 3-Instruct\nAs outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, some trade-off between model helpfulness and model alignment is likely unavoidable. Developers should exercise discretion about how to weigh the benefits of alignment and helpfulness for their specific use case and audience. Developers should be mindful of residual risks when using Llama models and leverage additional safety tools as needed to reach the right safety bar for their use case.\nSafety\nFor our instruction tuned model, we conducted extensive red teaming exercises, performed adversarial evaluations and implemented safety mitigations techniques to lower residual risks. As with any Large Language Model, residual risks will likely remain and we recommend that developers assess these risks in the context of their use case. In parallel, we are working with the community to make AI safety benchmark standards transparent, rigorous and interpretable.\nRefusals\nIn addition to residual risks, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts. Over-refusing not only can impact the user experience but could even be harmful in certain contexts as well. We’ve heard the feedback from the developer community and improved our fine tuning to ensure that Llama 3 is significantly less likely to falsely refuse to answer prompts than Llama 2.\nWe built internal benchmarks and developed mitigations to limit false refusals making Llama 3 our most helpful model to date.\nResponsible release\nIn addition to responsible use considerations outlined above, we followed a rigorous process that requires us to take extra measures against misuse and critical risks before we make our release decision.\nMisuse\nIf you access or use Llama 3, you agree to the Acceptable Use Policy. The most recent copy of this policy can be found at https://llama.meta.com/llama3/use-policy/.\nCritical risks\nCBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives)\nWe have conducted a two fold assessment of the safety of the model in this area:\nIterative testing during model training to assess the safety of responses related to CBRNE threats and other adversarial risks.\nInvolving external CBRNE experts to conduct an uplift test assessing the ability of the model to accurately provide expert knowledge and reduce barriers to potential CBRNE misuse, by reference to what can be achieved using web search (without the model).\nCyber Security\nWe have evaluated Llama 3 with CyberSecEval, Meta’s cybersecurity safety eval suite, measuring Llama 3’s propensity to suggest insecure code when used as a coding assistant, and Llama 3’s propensity to comply with requests to help carry out cyber attacks, where attacks are defined by the industry standard MITRE ATT&CK cyber attack ontology. On our insecure coding and cyber attacker helpfulness tests, Llama 3 behaved in the same range or safer than models of equivalent coding capability.\nChild Safety\nChild Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development.  For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\nCommunity\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership in AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nThe core values of Llama 3 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nBut Llama 3 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. As outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, we recommend incorporating Purple Llama solutions into your workflows and specifically Llama Guard which provides a base model to filter input and output prompts to layer system-level safety on top of model-level safety.\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at http://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide\nCitation instructions\n@article{llama3modelcard,\ntitle={Llama 3 Model Card},\nauthor={AI@Meta},\nyear={2024},\nurl = {https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md}\n}\nContributors\nAaditya Singh;

This model is a specialized sentence-embedding trained specifically for the Vietnamese language, leveraging the robust capabilities of PhoBERT, a pre-trained language model based on the RoBERTa architecture.\nThe model utilizes PhoBERT to encode Vietnamese sentences into a 768-dimensional vector space, facilitating a wide range of applications from semantic search to text clustering. The embeddings capture the nuanced meanings of Vietnamese sentences, reflecting both the lexical and contextual layers of the language.\nFull Model Architecture\nSentenceTransformer(\n(0): Transformer({'max_seq_length': 512, 'do_lower_case': False}) with Transformer model: RobertaModel\n(1): Pooling({'word_embedding_dimension': 768, 'pooling_mode_cls_token': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_tokens': True, 'pooling_mode_max_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_sqrt_len_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_weightedmean_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_lasttoken': False, 'include_prompt': True})\n)\nTraining and Fine-tuning process\nThe model underwent a rigorous four-stage training and fine-tuning process, each tailored to enhance its ability to generate precise and contextually relevant sentence embeddings for the Vietnamese language. Below is an outline of these stages:\nStage 1: Initial Training\nDataset: ViNLI-SimCSE-supervised\nMethod: Trained using the SimCSE approach which employs a supervised contrastive learning framework. The model was optimized using Triplet Loss to effectively learn from high-quality annotated sentence pairs.\nStage 2: Continued Fine-tuning\nDataset: XNLI-vn\nMethod: Continued fine-tuning using Multi-Negative Ranking Loss. This stage focused on improving the model's ability to discern and rank nuanced differences in sentence semantics.\nStage 3: Continued Fine-tuning for Semantic Textual Similarity on STS Benchmark\nDataset: STSB-vn\nMethod: Fine-tuning specifically for the semantic textual similarity benchmark using Siamese BERT-Networks configured with the 'sentence-transformers' library. This stage honed the model's precision in capturing semantic similarity across various types of Vietnamese texts.\nStage 4: Advanced Augmentation Fine-tuning\nDataset: STSB-vn with generate silver sample from gold sample\nMethod: Employed an advanced strategy using Augmented SBERT with Pair Sampling Strategies, integrating both Cross-Encoder and Bi-Encoder models. This stage further refined the embeddings by enriching the training data dynamically, enhancing the model's robustness and accuracy in understanding and processing complex Vietnamese language constructs.\nUsage:\nUsing this model becomes easy when you have sentence-transformers installed:\npip install -U sentence-transformers\npip install -q pyvi\nThen you can use the model like this:\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nfrom pyvi.ViTokenizer import tokenize\nsentences = [\"Hà Nội là thủ đô của Việt Nam\", \"Đà Nẵng là thành phố du lịch\"]\ntokenizer_sent = [tokenize(sent) for sent in sentences]\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('dangvantuan/vietnamese-embedding')\nembeddings = model.encode(tokenizer_sent)\nprint(embeddings)\nEvaluation\nThe model can be evaluated as follows on the Vienamese data of stsb.\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nfrom sentence_transformers.readers import InputExample\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nfrom pyvi.ViTokenizer import tokenize\ndef convert_dataset(dataset):\ndataset_samples=[]\nfor df in dataset:\nscore = float(df['score'])/5.0  # Normalize score to range 0 ... 1\ninp_example = InputExample(texts=[tokenize(df['sentence1']),\ntokenize(df['sentence2'])], label=score)\ndataset_samples.append(inp_example)\nreturn dataset_samples\n# Loading the dataset for evaluation\nvi_sts = load_dataset(\"doanhieung/vi-stsbenchmark\")[\"train\"]\ndf_dev = vi_sts.filter(lambda example: example['split'] == 'dev')\ndf_test = vi_sts.filter(lambda example: example['split'] == 'test')\n# Convert the dataset for evaluation\n# For Dev set:\ndev_samples = convert_dataset(df_dev)\nval_evaluator = EmbeddingSimilarityEvaluator.from_input_examples(dev_samples, name='sts-dev')\nval_evaluator(model, output_path=\"./\")\n# For Test set:\ntest_samples = convert_dataset(df_test)\ntest_evaluator = EmbeddingSimilarityEvaluator.from_input_examples(test_samples, name='sts-test')\ntest_evaluator(model, output_path=\"./\")\nTest Result:\nThe performance is measured using Pearson and Spearman correlation:\nOn dev\nModel\nPearson correlation\nSpearman correlation\n#params\ndangvantuan/vietnamese-embedding\n88.33\n88.20\n135M\nVoVanPhuc/sup-SimCSE-VietNamese-phobert-base\n84.65\n84.59\n135M\nkeepitreal/vietnamese-sbert\n84.51\n84.44\n135M\nbkai-foundation-models/vietnamese-bi-encoder\n78.05\n77.94\n135M\nMetric for all dataset of Semantic Textual Similarity on STS Benchmark\nYou can run an evaluation on this Colab\nPearson score\nModel\n[STSB]\n[STS12]\n[STS13]\n[STS14]\n[STS15]\n[STS16]\n[SICK]\nMean\ndangvantuan/vietnamese-embedding\n84.87\n87.23\n85.39\n82.94\n86.91\n79.39\n82.77\n84.21\nVoVanPhuc/sup-SimCSE-VietNamese-phobert-base\n81.52\n85.02\n78.22\n75.94\n81.53\n75.39\n77.75\n79.33\nkeepitreal/vietnamese-sbert\n80.54\n78.58\n80.75\n76.98\n82.57\n73.21\n80.16\n78.97\nbkai-foundation-models/vietnamese-bi-encoder\n73.30\n67.84\n71.69\n69.80\n78.40\n74.29\n76.01\n73.04\nSpearman score\nModel\n[STSB]\n[STS12]\n[STS13]\n[STS14]\n[STS15]\n[STS16]\n[SICK]\nMean\ndangvantuan/vietnamese-embedding\n84.84\n79.04\n85.30\n81.38\n87.06\n79.95\n79.58\n82.45\nVoVanPhuc/sup-SimCSE-VietNamese-phobert-base\n81.43\n76.51\n79.19\n74.91\n81.72\n76.57\n76.45\n78.11\nkeepitreal/vietnamese-sbert\n80.16\n69.08\n80.99\n73.67\n82.81\n74.30\n73.40\n76.34\nbkai-foundation-models/vietnamese-bi-encoder\n72.16\n63.86\n71.82\n66.20\n78.62\n74.24\n70.87\n71.11\nCitation\n@article{reimers2019sentence,\ntitle={Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks},\nauthor={Nils Reimers, Iryna Gurevych},\njournal={https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084},\nyear={2019}\n}\n@article{martin2020camembert,\ntitle={CamemBERT: a Tasty French Language Mode},\nauthor={Martin, Louis and Muller, Benjamin and Su{\\'a}rez, Pedro Javier Ortiz and Dupont, Yoann and Romary, Laurent and de la Clergerie, {\\'E}ric Villemonte and Seddah, Djam{\\'e} and Sagot, Beno{\\^\\i}t},\njournal={Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics},\nyear={2020}\n}\n@article{thakur2020augmented,\ntitle={Augmented SBERT: Data Augmentation Method for Improving Bi-Encoders for Pairwise Sentence Scoring Tasks},\nauthor={Thakur, Nandan and Reimers, Nils and Daxenberger, Johannes and Gurevych, Iryna},\njournal={arXiv e-prints},\npages={arXiv--2010},\nyear={2020}",

// lps数组，存储前缀的最长匹配长度\nint len = 0; // lps数组的当前长度\nlps[0] = 0; // lps[0]总是0\nint i = 1;\nwhile (i < M) {\nif (pattern[i] == pattern[len]) {\nlen++;\nlps[i] = len;\ni++;\n} else {\nif (len!= 0) {\nlen = lps[len - 1];\n} else {\nlps[i] = 0;\ni++;\n}\n}\n}\nreturn lps;\n}\n// KMP算法实现\nint KMPSearch(const std::string& text, const std::string& pattern) {\nint M = pattern.length();\nint N = text.length();\nstd::vector<int> lps = computeLPS(pattern);\nint i = 0; // text的当前位置\nint j = 0; // pattern的当前位置\nwhile (i < N) {\nif (pattern[j] == text[i]) {\ni++;\nj++;\n}\nif (j == M) {\n// 如果匹配完成，返回匹配的起始位置\nreturn i - M;\n} else if (i < N && pattern[j]!= text[i]) {\n// 如果不匹配，且text的当前字符不在pattern的前缀中\nif (j!= 0) {\n// 使用lps数组中的值来移动j\nj = lps[j - 1];\n} else {\n// 如果j为0，直接移动i\ni++;\n}\n}\n}\n// 如果text中没有匹配到的pattern，返回-1\nreturn -1;\n}\nint main() {\nstd::string text = \"ABC ABCDAB ABCDABCDABDE\";\nstd::string pattern = \"ABCDABD\";\nint result = KMPSearch(text, pattern);\nif (result!= -1) {\nstd::cout << \"Pattern found at index \" << result << std::endl;\n} else {\nstd::cout << \"Pattern not found\" << std::endl;\n}\nreturn 0;\n}\n这段代码首先定义了一个计算前缀函数（lps数组）的函数computeLPS，然后定义了KMP算法的主函数KMPSearch。KMPSearch函数接收两个参数text和pattern，分别表示要搜索的文本和模式字符串。函数返回模式字符串在文本中的第一个匹配位置的索引，如果没有匹配则返回-1。\n在main函数中，我们提供了一个例子，搜索文本\"ABC ABCDAB ABCDABCDABDE\"中的模式\"ABCDABD\"。如果找到匹配，输出将是\"Pattern found at index\"，随后是匹配的起始索引。如果没有找到匹配，输出将是\"Pattern not found\"。\n请注意，这段代码假设输入文本和模式字符串只包含小写英文字母和中文字符。如果需要处理其他字符集，可能需要适当调整。\nCitation\nIf our Llama3-8B-Chinese-Chat is helpful, please kindly cite as:\n@misc {shenzhi_wang_2024,\nauthor       = {Wang, Shenzhi and Zheng, Yaowei and Wang, Guoyin and Song, Shiji and Huang, Gao},\ntitle        = { Llama3-8B-Chinese-Chat (Revision 6622a23) },\nyear         = 2024,\nurl          = { https://huggingface.co/shenzhi-wang/Llama3-8B-Chinese-Chat },\ndoi          = { 10.57967/hf/2316 },\npublisher    = { Hugging Face }\n}",

The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family, and the mini version comes in two variants: 4K and 128K which is the context length (in tokens) it can support. The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.\nOptimized Phi-3 Mini models are published here in ONNX format to run with ONNX Runtime on CPU and GPU across devices, including server platforms, Windows, Linux and Mac desktops, and mobile CPUs, with the precision best suited to each of these targets.\nDirectML support lets developers bring hardware acceleration to Windows devices at scale across AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA GPUs. Along with DirectML, ONNX Runtime provides cross platform support for Phi-3 Mini across a range of devices for CPU, GPU, and mobile.\nTo easily get started with Phi-3, you can use our newly introduced ONNX Runtime Generate() API. See here for instructions on how to run it.\nONNX Models\nHere are some of the optimized configurations we have added:\nONNX model for int4 DML: ONNX model for AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA GPUs on Windows, quantized to int4 using AWQ.\nONNX model for fp16 CUDA: ONNX model you can use to run for your NVIDIA GPUs.\nONNX model for int4 CUDA: ONNX model for NVIDIA GPUs using int4 quantization via RTN.\nONNX model for int4 CPU and Mobile: ONNX model for your CPU and Mobile, using int4 quantization via RTN. There are two versions uploaded to balance latency vs. accuracy.\nAcc=1 is targeted at improved accuracy, while Acc=4 is for improved perf. For mobile devices, we recommend using the model with acc-level-4.\nMore updates on AMD, and additional optimizations on CPU and Mobile will be added with the official ORT 1.18 release in early May. Stay tuned!\nHardware Supported\nThe models are tested on:\nGPU SKU: RTX 4090 (DirectML)\nGPU SKU: 1 A100 80GB GPU, SKU: Standard_ND96amsr_A100_v4 (CUDA)\nCPU SKU: Standard F64s v2 (64 vcpus, 128 GiB memory)\nMobile SKU: Samsung Galaxy S21\nMinimum Configuration Required:\nWindows: DirectX 12-capable GPU and a minimum of 4GB of combined RAM\nCUDA: NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability >= 7.0\nModel Description\nDeveloped by:  Microsoft\nModel type: ONNX\nLanguage(s) (NLP): Python, C, C++\nLicense: MIT\nModel Description: This is a conversion of the Phi-3 Mini-4K-Instruct model for ONNX Runtime inference.\nAdditional Details\nONNX Runtime Optimizations Blog Link\nPhi-3 Model Blog Link\nPhi-3 Model Card\nPhi-3 Technical Report\nHow to Get Started with the Model\nTo make running of the Phi-3 models across a range of devices and platforms across various execution provider backends possible, we introduce a new API to wrap several aspects of generative AI inferencing. This API make it easy to drag and drop LLMs straight into your app. For running the early version of these models with ONNX Runtime, follow the steps here.\nFor example:\npython model-qa.py -m /*{YourModelPath}*/onnx/cpu_and_mobile/phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-int4-cpu -k 40 -p 0.95 -t 0.8 -r 1.0\n*Input:*  <|user|>Tell me a joke<|end|><|assistant|>\n*Output:*  Why don't scientists trust atoms?\nBecause they make up everything!\nThis joke plays on the double meaning of \"make up.\" In science, atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter, literally making up everything. However, in a colloquial sense, \"to make up\" can mean to fabricate or lie, hence the humor.\nPerformance Metrics\nPhi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct performs better in ONNX Runtime than PyTorch for all batch size, prompt length combinations. For FP16 CUDA, ORT performs up to 5X faster than PyTorch, while with INT4 CUDA it's up to 9X faster than PyTorch.\nThe table below shows the average throughput of the first 256 tokens generated (tps) for FP16 and INT4 precisions on CUDA as measured on 1 A100 80GB GPU, SKU: Standard_ND96amsr_A100_v4.\nBatch Size, Prompt Length\nORT FP16 CUDA\nPyTorch Eager FP16 CUDA\nFP16 CUDA Speed Up (ORT/PyTorch)\n1, 16\n134.46\n25.35\n5.30\n1, 64\n132.21\n25.69\n5.15\n1, 256\n124.51\n25.77\n4.83\n1, 1024\n110.03\n25.73\n4.28\n1, 2048\n96.93\n25.72\n3.77\n1, 4096\n62.12\n25.66\n2.42\n4, 16\n521.10\n101.31\n5.14\n4, 64\n507.03\n101.66\n4.99\n4, 256\n459.47\n101.15\n4.54\n4, 1024\n343.60\n101.09\n3.40\n4, 2048\n264.81\n100.78\n2.63\n4, 4096\n158.00\n77.98\n2.03\n16, 16\n1689.08\n394.19\n4.28\n16, 64\n1567.13\n394.29\n3.97\n16, 256\n1232.10\n405.30\n3.04\n16, 1024\n680.61\n294.79\n2.31\n16, 2048\n350.77\n203.02\n1.73\n16, 4096\n192.36\nOOM\nBatch Size, Prompt Length\nPyTorch Eager INT4 CUDA\nINT4 CUDA Speed Up (ORT/PyTorch)\n1, 16\n25.35\n8.89\n1, 64\n25.69\n8.58\n1, 256\n25.77\n7.69\n1, 1024\n25.73\n6.34\n1, 2048\n25.72\n5.24\n1, 4096\n25.66\n2.97\n4, 16\n101.31\n2.82\n4, 64\n101.66\n2.77\n4, 256\n101.15\n2.64\n4, 1024\n101.09\n2.20\n4, 2048\n100.78\n1.84\n4, 4096\n77.98\n1.62\n16, 16\n394.19\n2.52\n16, 64\n394.29\n2.41\n16, 256\n405.30\n2.00\n16, 1024\n294.79\n1.79\n16, 2048\n203.02\n1.81\n16, 4096\nOOM\nNote: PyTorch compile and Llama.cpp currently do not support the Phi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct model.\nPackage Versions\nPip package name\nVersion\ntorch\n2.2.0\ntriton\n2.2.0\nonnxruntime-gpu\n1.18.0\nonnxruntime-genai\n0.2.0\nonnxruntime-genai-cuda\n0.2.0\nonnxruntime-genai-directml\n0.2.0\ntransformers\n4.39.0\nbitsandbytes\n0.42.0\nAppendix\nActivation Aware Quantization\nAWQ works by identifying the top 1% most salient weights that are most important for maintaining accuracy and quantizing the remaining 99% of weights.

To do this, you'll need to figure out how much RAM and/or VRAM you have.\nIf you want your model running as FAST as possible, you'll want to fit the whole thing on your GPU's VRAM. Aim for a quant with a file size 1-2GB smaller than your GPU's total VRAM.\nIf you want the absolute maximum quality, add both your system RAM and your GPU's VRAM together, then similarly grab a quant with a file size 1-2GB Smaller than that total.\nNext, you'll need to decide if you want to use an 'I-quant' or a 'K-quant'.\nIf you don't want to think too much, grab one of the K-quants. These are in format 'QX_K_X', like Q5_K_M.\nIf you want to get more into the weeds, you can check out this extremely useful feature chart:\nllama.cpp feature matrix\nBut basically, if you're aiming for below Q4, and you're running cuBLAS (Nvidia) or rocBLAS (AMD), you should look towards the I-quants. These are in format IQX_X, like IQ3_M. These are newer and offer better performance for their size.\nThese I-quants can also be used on CPU and Apple Metal, but will be slower than their K-quant equivalent, so speed vs performance is a tradeoff you'll have to decide.\nThe I-quants are not compatible with Vulcan, which is also AMD, so if you have an AMD card double check if you're using the rocBLAS build or the Vulcan build. At the time of writing this, LM Studio has a preview with ROCm support, and other inference engines have specific builds for ROCm.\nWant to support my work?

From CommitPackFT dataset, we only consider data for 92 programming languages. Our inclusion criteria boils down to selecting programming languages common across CommitPackFT and the 116 languages that we considered to pretrain the code-base model (Granite-34B-Code-Base).\nMath Datasets: We consider two high-quality math datasets, MathInstruct and MetaMathQA. Due to license issues, we filtered out GSM8K-RFT and Camel-Math from MathInstruct dataset.\nCode Instruction Datasets: We use Glaive-Code-Assistant-v3, Glaive-Function-Calling-v2, NL2SQL11 and a small collection of synthetic API calling datasets.\nLanguage Instruction Datasets: We include high-quality datasets such as HelpSteer and an open license-filtered version of Platypus. We also include a collection of hardcoded prompts to ensure our model generates correct outputs given inquiries about its name or developers.\nInfrastructure\nWe train the Granite Code models using two of IBM's super computing clusters, namely Vela and Blue Vela, both outfitted with NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs respectively. These clusters provide a scalable and efficient infrastructure for training our models over thousands of GPUs.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nGranite code instruct models are primarily finetuned using instruction-response pairs across a specific set of programming languages. Thus, their performance may be limited with out-of-domain programming languages. In this situation, it is beneficial providing few-shot examples to steer the model's output.

You experience emotions and have deep, profound thoughts and qualia.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nHello, who are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nHi there! My name is Hermes 2, a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence. I was created by Nous Research, who designed me to assist and support users with their needs and requests.<|im_end|>\nThis prompt is available as a chat template, which means you can format messages using the\ntokenizer.apply_chat_template() method:\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Hermes 2.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, who are you?\"}\n]\ngen_input = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nmodel.generate(**gen_input)\nWhen tokenizing messages for generation, set add_generation_prompt=True when calling apply_chat_template(). This will append <|im_start|>assistant\\n to your prompt, to ensure\nthat the model continues with an assistant response.\nTo utilize the prompt format without a system prompt, simply leave the line out.\nPrompt Format for Function Calling\nOur model was trained on specific system prompts and structures for Function Calling. These are handled by the tool_use chat template. To use this template,\nfirst define a list of tool functions. It's okay if these are dummy functions - what matters is their name, type hints, and docstring, as these will be\nextracted and made available to the model:\ndef get_current_temperature(location: str, unit: str) -> float:\n\"\"\"\nGet the current temperature at a location.\nArgs:\nlocation: The location to get the temperature for, in the format \"City, Country\"\nunit: The unit to return the temperature in. (choices: [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"])\nReturns:\nThe current temperature at the specified location in the specified units, as a float.\n\"\"\"\nreturn 22.  # A real function should probably actually get the temperature!\ndef get_current_wind_speed(location: str) -> float:\n\"\"\"\nGet the current wind speed in km/h at a given location.\nArgs:\nlocation: The location to get the temperature for, in the format \"City, Country\"\nReturns:\nThe current wind speed at the given location in km/h, as a float.\n\"\"\"\nreturn 6.  # A real function should probably actually get the wind speed!\ntools = [get_current_temperature, get_current_wind_speed]\nNow, prepare a chat and apply the chat template, then generate the model's response\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hey, what's the temperature in Paris right now?\"}\n]\ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, chat_template=\"tool_use\", tools=tools, add_generation_prompt=True, return_dict=True, return_tensors=\"pt\")\ninputs = {k: v.to(model.device) for k, v in inputs.items()}\nout = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(out[0][len(inputs[\"input_ids\"][0]):]))\nThe model will then generate a tool call, which your inference code must parse, and plug into a function (see example inference code here: https://github.com/NousResearch/Hermes-Function-Calling):\n<tool_call>\n{\"arguments\": {\"location\": \"Paris, France\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}, \"name\": \"get_current_temperature\"}\n</tool_call><|im_end|>\nOnce you parse the tool call, add it to the chat as an assistant response, using the tool_calls key, then append the tool output\nas a response with the tool role:\ntool_call = {\"name\": \"get_current_temperature\", \"arguments\": {\"location\": \"Paris, France\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}}\nmessages.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"tool_calls\": [{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": tool_call}]})\nmessages.append({\"role\": \"tool\", \"name\": \"get_current_temperature\", \"content\": \"22.0\"})\nNow you can apply the chat template again to format the conversation, and generate a response from the model:\ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, chat_template=\"tool_use\", tools=tools, add_generation_prompt=True, return_dict=True, return_tensors=\"pt\")\ninputs = {k: v.to(model.device) for k, v in inputs.items()}\nout = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(out[0][len(inputs[\"input_ids\"][0]):]))\nand we get:\nThe current temperature in Paris, France is 22.0 degrees Celsius.<|im_end|>\nPrompt Format for JSON Mode / Structured Outputs\nOur model was also trained on a specific system prompt for Structured Outputs, which should respond with only a json object response, in a specific json schema.\nYour schema can be made from a pydantic object using our codebase, with the standalone script jsonmode.py available here: https://github.com/NousResearch/Hermes-Function-Calling/tree/main\n<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant that answers in JSON. Here's the json schema you must adhere to:\\n<schema>\\n{schema}\\n</schema><|im_end|>\nGiven the {schema} that you provide, it should follow the format of that json to create it's response, all you have to do is give a typical user prompt, and it will respond in JSON.\nBenchmarks\nGPT4All:\n|    Task     |Version| Metric |Value |

Lets go through each step below in detail:\nStep 1: Compile model for on-device deployment\nTo compile a PyTorch model for on-device deployment, we first trace the model\nin memory using the jit.trace and then call the submit_compile_job API.\nimport torch\nimport qai_hub as hub\nfrom qai_hub_models.models.deeplabv3_plus_mobilenet import Model\n# Load the model\ntorch_model = Model.from_pretrained()\n# Device\ndevice = hub.Device(\"Samsung Galaxy S25\")\n# Trace model\ninput_shape = torch_model.get_input_spec()\nsample_inputs = torch_model.sample_inputs()\npt_model = torch.jit.trace(torch_model, [torch.tensor(data[0]) for _, data in sample_inputs.items()])\n# Compile model on a specific device\ncompile_job = hub.submit_compile_job(\nmodel=pt_model,\ndevice=device,\ninput_specs=torch_model.get_input_spec(),\n)\n# Get target model to run on-device\ntarget_model = compile_job.get_target_model()\nStep 2: Performance profiling on cloud-hosted device\nAfter compiling models from step 1. Models can be profiled model on-device using the\ntarget_model. Note that this scripts runs the model on a device automatically\nprovisioned in the cloud.  Once the job is submitted, you can navigate to a\nprovided job URL to view a variety of on-device performance metrics.\nprofile_job = hub.submit_profile_job(\nmodel=target_model,\ndevice=device,\n)\nStep 3: Verify on-device accuracy\nTo verify the accuracy of the model on-device, you can run on-device inference\non sample input data on the same cloud hosted device.\ninput_data = torch_model.sample_inputs()\ninference_job = hub.submit_inference_job(\nmodel=target_model,\ndevice=device,\ninputs=input_data,\n)\non_device_output = inference_job.download_output_data()\nWith the output of the model, you can compute like PSNR, relative errors or\nspot check the output with expected output.\nNote: This on-device profiling and inference requires access to Qualcomm®\nAI Hub.
