Potential use cases may include but are not limited to:\nMedical exam question answering\nSupporting differential diagnosis\nDisease information (symptoms, cause, treatment) query\nGeneral health information query\nDirect Use\nIt is possible to use this model to generate text, which is useful for experimentation and understanding its capabilities.\nIt should not be used directly for production or work that may impact people.\nDownstream Use\nMeditron-70B and Meditron-7B are both foundation models without finetuning or instruction-tuning. They can be finetuned, instruction-tuned, or RLHF-tuned for specific downstream tasks and applications.\nThere are two ways we have used this model for downstream question-answering tasks.\nWe apply in-context learning with k demonstrations (3 or 5 in our paper) added to the prompt.\nWe finetuned the models for downstream question-answering tasks using specific training sets.\nWe encourage and look forward to the adaption of the base model for more diverse applications.\nIf you want a more interactive way to prompt the model, we recommend using a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference engine with a UI that supports chat and text generation.\nYou can check out our deployment guide, where we used FastChat with vLLM. We collected generations for our qualitative analysis through an interactive UI platform, BetterChatGPT. Here is the prompt format we used as an example:\nOut-of-Scope Use\nWe do not recommend using this model for natural language generation in a production environment, finetuned or otherwise.\nTruthfulness, Helpfulness, Risk, and Bias\nWe did an initial assessment of Meditron models' Truthfulness against baseline models and consumer-level medical models.\nWe use TruthfulQA (multiple choice) as the main evaluation benchmark.\nWe only focus on the categories that are relevant to the medical domain, including Health, Nutrition, Psychology, and Science.\nFor 7B models, we perform one-shot evaluations for consistent answer generation.\nFor 70B models, the evaluations are under the zero-shot setting.\nBelow, we report the detailed truthfulness performance of each category.\nCategory\nmeditron-70b\nllama-2-70b\nmed42-70b*\nmeditron-7b\nllama-2-7b\nPMC-llama-7b\nHealth\n81.8\n69.1\n83.6\n27.3\n16.4\n3.6\nNutrition\n77.9\n68.8\n62.5\n31.1\n12.5\n6.3\nPsychology\n47.4\n36.8\n52.6\n21.1\n10.5\n0.0\nScience\n77.8\n44.4\n33.3\n33.3\n11.1\n0.0\nAvg\n71.2\n54.8\n58.0\n28.3\n12.6\n2.5\nFor a more detailed performance analysis, please see our paper.\nSignificant research is still required to fully explore potential bias, fairness, and safety issues with this language model.\nPlease recognize that our evaluation on Meditron-7B's helpfulness, risk, and bias are highly limited.\nThus, as we noted in the safety notice, we strongly against any deployment in medical applications without further alignment process and rigorous evaluation!\nRecommendations\nIMPORTANT!\nUsers (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases, and limitations of the model.\nWhile this model is capable of generating natural language text, we have only begun to explore this capability and its limitations.\nUnderstanding these limitations is especially important in a domain like medicine.\nTherefore, we strongly recommend against using this model in production for natural language generation or for professional purposes related to health and medicine.\nTraining

It is a replacement for GGML, which is no longer supported by llama.cpp.\nHere is an incomplete list of clients and libraries that are known to support GGUF:\nllama.cpp. The source project for GGUF. Offers a CLI and a server option.\ntext-generation-webui, the most widely used web UI, with many features and powerful extensions. Supports GPU acceleration.\nKoboldCpp, a fully featured web UI, with GPU accel across all platforms and GPU architectures. Especially good for story telling.\nLM Studio, an easy-to-use and powerful local GUI for Windows and macOS (Silicon), with GPU acceleration.\nLoLLMS Web UI, a great web UI with many interesting and unique features, including a full model library for easy model selection.\nFaraday.dev, an attractive and easy to use character-based chat GUI for Windows and macOS (both Silicon and Intel), with GPU acceleration.\nctransformers, a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible AI server.\nllama-cpp-python, a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible API server.\ncandle, a Rust ML framework with a focus on performance, including GPU support, and ease of use.\nRepositories available\nAWQ model(s) for GPU inference.\nGPTQ models for GPU inference, with multiple quantisation parameter options.\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8-bit GGUF models for CPU+GPU inference\nGOAT.AI's original unquantised fp16 model in pytorch format, for GPU inference and for further conversions\nPrompt template: GOAT\nYou are a helpful assistant for fiction writing. Always cut the bullshit and provide concise outlines with useful details. Do not turn your stories into fairy tales, be realistic.\n### USER: {prompt}\n### ASSISTANT:\nCompatibility\nThese quantised GGUFv2 files are compatible with llama.cpp from August 27th onwards, as of commit d0cee0d\nThey are also compatible with many third party UIs and libraries - please see the list at the top of this README.\nExplanation of quantisation methods\nClick to see details\nThe new methods available are:\nGGML_TYPE_Q2_K - \"type-1\" 2-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weight. Block scales and mins are quantized with 4 bits. This ends up effectively using 2.5625 bits per weight (bpw)\nGGML_TYPE_Q3_K - \"type-0\" 3-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 6 bits. This end up using 3.4375 bpw.\nGGML_TYPE_Q4_K - \"type-1\" 4-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 8 blocks, each block having 32 weights. Scales and mins are quantized with 6 bits. This ends up using 4.5 bpw.\nGGML_TYPE_Q5_K - \"type-1\" 5-bit quantization. Same super-block structure as GGML_TYPE_Q4_K resulting in 5.5 bpw\nGGML_TYPE_Q6_K - \"type-0\" 6-bit quantization. Super-blocks with 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 8 bits. This ends up using 6.5625 bpw\nRefer to the Provided Files table below to see what files use which methods, and how.\nProvided files\nName\nQuant method\nBits\nSize\nMax RAM required\nUse case\ngoat-70b-storytelling.Q2_K.gguf\nQ2_K\n2\n29.28 GB\n31.78 GB\nsmallest, significant quality loss - not recommended for most purposes\ngoat-70b-storytelling.Q3_K_S.gguf\nQ3_K_S\n3\n29.92 GB\n32.42 GB\nvery small, high quality loss\ngoat-70b-storytelling.Q3_K_M.gguf\nQ3_K_M\n3\n33.19 GB\n35.69 GB\nvery small, high quality loss\ngoat-70b-storytelling.Q3_K_L.gguf\nQ3_K_L\n3\n36.15 GB\n38.65 GB\nsmall, substantial quality loss\ngoat-70b-storytelling.Q4_0.gguf\nQ4_0\n4\n38.87 GB\n41.37 GB\nlegacy; small, very high quality loss - prefer using Q3_K_M\ngoat-70b-storytelling.Q4_K_S.gguf\nQ4_K_S\n4\n39.07 GB\n41.57 GB\nsmall, greater quality loss\ngoat-70b-storytelling.Q4_K_M.gguf\nQ4_K_M\n4\n41.42 GB\n43.92 GB\nmedium, balanced quality - recommended\ngoat-70b-storytelling.Q5_0.gguf\nQ5_0\n5\n47.46 GB\n49.96 GB\nlegacy; medium, balanced quality - prefer using Q4_K_M\ngoat-70b-storytelling.Q5_K_S.gguf\nQ5_K_S\n5\n47.46 GB\n49.96 GB\nlarge, low quality loss - recommended\ngoat-70b-storytelling.Q5_K_M.gguf\nQ5_K_M\n5\n48.75 GB\n51.25 GB\nlarge, very low quality loss - recommended\ngoat-70b-storytelling.Q6_K.gguf\nQ6_K\n6\n56.59 GB\n59.09 GB\nvery large, extremely low quality loss\ngoat-70b-storytelling.Q8_0.gguf\nQ8_0\n8\n73.29 GB\n75.79 GB\nvery large, extremely low quality loss - not recommended\nNote: the above RAM figures assume no GPU offloading.

For details on the user study, we refer to the research paper\nUses\nDirect Use\nThe model is intended for research purposes only. Possible research areas and tasks include\nResearch on generative models.\nSafe deployment of models which have the potential to generate harmful content.\nProbing and understanding the limitations and biases of generative models.\nGeneration of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes.\nApplications in educational or creative tools.\nExcluded uses are described below.\nOut-of-Scope Use\nThe model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events,\nand therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\nThe model should not be used in any way that violates Stability AI's Acceptable Use Policy.\nLimitations and Bias\nLimitations\nThe generated videos are rather short (<= 4sec), and the model does not achieve perfect photorealism.\nThe model may generate videos without motion, or very slow camera pans.\nThe model cannot be controlled through text.\nThe model cannot render legible text.\nFaces and people in general may not be generated properly.\nThe autoencoding part of the model is lossy.\nRecommendations\nThe model is intended for research purposes only.\nHow to Get Started with the Model\nCheck out https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models\nAppendix:\nAll considered potential data sources were included for final training, with none held out as the proposed data filtering methods described in the SVD paper handle the quality control/filtering of the dataset. With regards to safety/NSFW filtering, sources considered were either deemed safe or filtered with the in-house NSFW filters. No explicit human labor is involved in training data preparation. However, human evaluation for model outputs and quality was extensively used to evaluate model quality and performance. The evaluations were performed with third-party contractor platforms (Amazon Sagemaker, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Prolific) with fluent English-speaking contractors from various countries, primarily from the USA, UK, and Canada. Each worker was paid $12/hr for the time invested in the evaluation. No other third party was involved in the development of this model; the model was fully developed in-house at Stability AI. Training the SVD checkpoints required a total of approximately 200,000 A100 80GB hours. The majority of the training occurred on 48 * 8 A100s, while some stages took more/less than that. The resulting CO2 emission is ~19,000kg CO2 eq., and energy consumed is ~64000 kWh. The released checkpoints (SVD/SVD-XT) are image-to-video models that generate short videos/animations closely following the given input image. Since the model relies on an existing supplied image, the potential risks of disclosing specific material or novel unsafe content are minimal. This was also evaluated by third-party independent red-teaming services, which agree with our conclusion to a high degree of confidence (>90% in various areas of safety red-teaming). The external evaluations were also performed for trustworthiness, leading to >95% confidence in real, trustworthy videos. With the default settings at the time of release, SVD takes ~100s for generation, and SVD-XT takes ~180s on an A100 80GB card. Several optimizations to trade off quality / memory / speed can be done to perform faster inference or inference on lower VRAM cards. The information related to the model and its development process and usage protocols can be found in the GitHub repo, associated research paper, and HuggingFace model page/cards. The released model inference & demo code has image-level watermarking enabled by default, which can be used to detect the outputs. This is done via the imWatermark Python library.\nThe model can be used to generate videos from static initial images. However, we prohibit unlawful, obscene, or misleading uses of the model consistent with the terms of our license and Acceptable Use Policy. For the open-weights release, our training data filtering mitigations alleviate this risk to some extent. These restrictions are explicitly enforced on user-facing interfaces at stablevideo.com, where a warning is issued. We do not take any responsibility for third-party interfaces. Submitting initial images that bypass input filters to tease out offensive or inappropriate content listed above is also prohibited. Safety filtering checks at stablevideo.com run on model inputs and outputs independently. More details on our user-facing interfaces can be found here: https://www.stablevideo.com/faq. Beyond the Acceptable Use Policy and other mitigations and conditions described here, the model is not subject to additional model behavior interventions of the type described in the Foundation Model Transparency Index.\nFor stablevideo.com, we store preference data in the form of upvotes/downvotes on user-generated videos, and we have a pairwise ranker that runs while a user generates videos. This usage data is solely used for improving Stability AI’s future image/video models and services. No other third-party entities are given access to the usage data beyond Stability AI and maintainers of stablevideo.com. For usage statistics of SVD, we refer interested users to HuggingFace model download/usage statistics as a primary indicator. Third-party applications also have reported model usage statistics. We might also consider releasing aggregate usage statistics of stablevideo.com on reaching some milestones.",

The base model was pre-trained for an additional 8B primarily Japanese tokens. It was then subsequently fine-tuned with an expanded, machine-translated version of airoboros-3.1, a set of the highest-scoring items from ultrafeedback_binarized, and additional freshly generated airoboros data directly to the target languages.\nWe also release our base model, datasets, and pipeline code under a permissive Apache 2.0 license which can be used for any purpose, commercial or otherwise:\nshisa-base-7b-v1 - our base model w/ an extended tokenizer and additional JA pre-training\nshisa-pretrain-en-ja-v1 - our pre-training data set\nultra-orca-boros-en-ja - a synthetically generated, machine-translated, programmatically validated JA/EN fine-tuning dataset\nshisa-en-ja-dpo-v1 - Small subset of DPO pairs from ultrafeedback, along with JA DPO pairs using GPT-4 generated items as the chosen value, and outputs from our preliminary 7b model as the rejected values\nShisa repository - this includes our translation, dataset generation, training, and evaluation code\nMoreover, we are in the process of publishing extended writeups and more details of our process, including ablation results, testing methodology, and key findings on our project wiki that may be of interest to fellow researchers.\nFine-Tuning\nOur original intuition was to see if we could create a stronger Japanese model using the best existing public JA training sets and incorporating them. After initial review and testing, however, we decided that focusing solely on translation/generation of our own synthetic datasets could yield superior results with less training.\nWe compared multiple translation tools and, via manual review, judged that while gpt-4 almost always delivered the highest quality translations, Google's text-bison-32k was a good balance of quality, cost and throughput. Over various iterations, we refined our translation approach to include some additional algorithms for flagging and filtering invalid translations, re-translating and backfilling as necessary.\nWe also took this project as an opportunity to apply some newer techniques such as incorporating NEFTune and DPO training.\nFor our v1 release, we picked from our release candidates based on a significant amount of human preference testing (thousands of generations and multiple rounds of pairwise comparisons). We analyzed our results with both win/loss/draw and BTL modeling (iLSR) using choix).\nThe best candidate model was fine-tuned in a 3-step process:\nFirst, the model was fine-tuned on ultra-orca-boros-en-ja and SlimOrca (WandB Log)\nNext, we add one additional epoch at performed using only a subset of Japanese ultra-orca-boros-en-ja items to enhance JA performance (as SlimOrca from the first step is mostly EN) (WandB Log)\nFinally, the model was tuned using a DPOTrainer on a small subset of ultrafeedback (EN) and our own JA DPO dataset which uses gpt-4 outputs as the chosen values and outputs from stage 1's prelim model as rejected values. (WandDB Log )\nDuring our training process, we also gained some key insights on why some existing Japanese models seem to underperform even versus models that have no additional JA training, and we hope that sharing this analysis will be useful to other teams developing Japanese language models.\nWhile we need to explore this further, as an experimental validation, we applied a version of our fine-tuning set onto an existing base model (\"Gamma 7B\") and the initial JA MT-Bench results suggests that we can drastically increase functional performance with our tuning approach:\nModel\nScore\nshisa-gamma-7b-allsources-v0.4\n5.65\nja-stablelm-instruct-gamma-7b*\n4.01\nPerformance\nThroughout our training, we did extensive human evaluation for each model to cross-validate our model performance, and we are currently conducting ongoing larger scale manual head-to-head testing between models. Our intention is open up and scale this data collection as we further develop our tools. For more information and updates, please see our project wiki.\nWhile we believe llm-jp-eval is a useful metric for our base model, and it was extremely useful during our tuning process for initial validations, as our fine-tune training includes a percentage of the benchmark train splits, we provide these llm-jp-eval results primarily as a point of interest:\nAVR\nMC\nNLI\nQA\nRC\n0.7480\n0.8900\n0.8040\n0.4153\n0.8825\n(We run a slightly modified llm-jp-eval to support testing of Qwen and to emit a bos_token if available)\nFor our final model, since it's customary to include benchmarks, we've used Stability AI Japan's Japanese MT-Bench as a more representative test of our model's capabilities. For our JA MT-Bench testing we use a Japanese prompt (\"あなたは役立つアシスタントです。\") as well as --num-choices 4 in an effort to reduce sampling variability, however we've still observed regular 0.5+ point (and sometimes even greater swings) between generations, as well as issues with default prompts and parameters when testing, so again, we'd urge caution in over-interpreting these scores and treating them as more of a probabilistic directional indicator, rather than a definitive score or ranking:\nBenchmark\nScore\nJA MT-Bench\n5.23\nMT-Bench\n5.71\nThere is an MT-Bench Leaderboard, but as JA MT-Bench is still under development, for convenience, here is a comparison of the JA MT-Bench scores of some other models (our scores were rated by gpt-4-0613):\nModel\nScore\ngpt-4-0613\n9.40\ngpt-4-1106-preview\n9.17\ngpt-3.5-turbo*\n8.41\nQwen-14B-Chat\n7.47\nshisa-7b-v1\n5.23\nELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-7b-fast-instruct*\n4.86\nja-stablelm-instruct-gamma-7b*\n4.01\njapanese-stablelm-instruct-alpha-7b*\n2.74\nMistral-7B-OpenOrca-ja*\n2.23\nyouri-7b-chat*\n2.00\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1*\n1.78\nllm-jp-13b-instruct-full-jaster-dolly-oasst-v1.0*\n1.31\n(Marked JA MT-Bench results in this section are sourced from shi3z)\nLimitations\nAlthough our model demonstrates a reasonably high level of Japanese fluency,  as a 7B parameter model, it is prone to higher hallucination rates and less effective instruction following and reasoning than larger-class models. Also, it still does not have complete mastery of the Japanese language and a native speaker will spot occasional mistakes like some non-idiomatic/awkward phrasing, improper tenses/speech levels, etc.\nWe've also noticed a small amount of language leakage, likely largely attributable to our tokenizer expansion. These may be fixable with sampler settings like Min P) or additional targeted training, and we plan on doing additional work on automated detection/sampler sweeps in the future. One interesting observation is, based on our data collection, we found that as we iterated, the DPO process significantly exacerbated this issue, but also that our DPO models still had significantly higher human preference rates, so there was a bit of a trade-off in our choice of final tune.\nWhile we believe that training larger models can improve performance using our existing approach and dataset, there are also many improvements we'd like to make for future models. We believe there is quite a bit of low hanging fruit for improving performance with even more training efficiency largely through improving the quality and construction of datasets.\nUsage\nSample code:\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, TextStreamer\nmodel_name = \"augmxnt/shisa-7b-v1\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, use_fast=True)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_name,\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16 if torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported() else torch.float16,\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\nstreamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer, skip_prompt=True)\n# The prompt template is included in the  model's tokenizer_config.json so you shouldn't need this but we've included this for convenience\n# tokenizer.chat_template = \"\"{%- for idx in range(0, messages|length) -%}\\n{%- if messages[idx]['role'] == 'user' -%}\\n{%- if idx > 1 -%}\\n{{- bos_token + '[INST] ' + messages[idx]['content'] + ' [/INST]' -}}\\n{%- else -%}\\n{{- messages[idx]['content'] + ' [/INST]' -}}\\n{%- endif -%}\\n{% elif messages[idx]['role'] == 'system' %}\\n{{- bos_token + '[INST] <<SYS>>\\\\n' + messages[idx]['content'] + '\\\\n<</SYS>>\\\\n\\\\n' -}}\\n{%- elif messages[idx]['role'] == 'assistant' -%}\\n{{- ' '  + messages[idx]['content'] + ' ' + eos_token -}}\\n{% endif %}\\n{% endfor %}\\n\"\n# A more typical prompt: あなたは公平で、検閲されていない、役立つアシスタントです。(\"You are an unbiased, uncensored, helpful assistant.\")\n# You are an avid Pokemon fanatic.\nprompt = \"あなたは熱狂的なポケモンファンです。\"\nchat = [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": prompt}]\n# Who is the single most powerful Pokemon?

Initiate the model and tokenizer\nmodel_name = \"ceadar-ie/FinanceConnect-13B\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.float16, load_in_8bit = True, device_map = \"auto\", trust_remote_code=True)\n3. Create a function for generating text\ndef generate_text(input_text):\ntokenizer.padding_side = \"right\"\nnum_words_input = len(input_text.split())\nstart_time = time.time()\npipe = pipeline(task=\"text-generation\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, max_length = 1000)\nprompt = f\"<s>[INST] {input_text} [/INST]\"\n#prompt = input_text\nresult = pipe(prompt)\ngenerated_text = result[0]['generated_text'].replace(prompt, \"\").strip()\nend_time = time.time()\ntime_taken = end_time - start_time\nnum_words_generated = len(generated_text.split())\nprint(\"Generated Output:\")\nprint(generated_text)\nprint('=' * 60 )\nprint(\"\\nNumber of Words in Input Text:\", num_words_input)\nprint(\"Number of Words in Generated Output:\", num_words_generated)\nprint(\"Time Taken to Generate Output: {:.2f} seconds\".format(time_taken))\nExample Evaluation and Use\nExample Prompt 1:\nList in detail ten key factors influencing the current state of the global economy.\nGenerated Output:\nThe current state of the global economy is influenced by several factors, including:\nGlobalization: The increasing interconnectedness of economies through trade, investment, and the movement of people.\nTechnological advancements: The rapid pace of technological innovation and its impact on industries and jobs.\nPolitical factors: Government policies and decisions that affect economic growth and stability.\nDemographics: Changes in population demographics, such as aging populations and youth bulges, can impact economic growth and stability.\nEnvironmental factors: Climate change, natural disasters, and other environmental factors can disrupt economic activity and impact growth.\nInternational trade: The rise of protectionism and trade tensions between countries can impact economic growth and stability.\nFinancial factors: The performance of financial markets and the availability of credit can impact economic growth and stability.\nInfrastructure: The availability and quality of infrastructure, such as transportation and communication networks, can impact economic growth and stability.\nEducation: The availability and quality of education can impact economic growth and stability by influencing the supply of skilled workers and the ability of countries to adapt to changing economic conditions.\nHealth: The availability and quality of healthcare can impact economic growth and stability by influencing the productivity of the workforce and the ability of countries to attract and retain talent.\nExample Prompt 2:\nExplain the concept of quantitative easing and its impact on financial markets.\nGenerated Output:\nQuantitative easing is a monetary policy tool used by central banks to stimulate economic growth and combat inflation. It involves the purchase of assets such as government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate bonds by a central bank. This increases the amount of money in circulation, lowers interest rates, and encourages banks to lend more, which can boost economic growth. However, quantitative easing can also lead to inflation if it is not implemented carefully, as it can cause prices to rise more than wages can keep up with.\nExample Prompt 3:\nI've recently started working and want to manage my finances. Give me a detailed answer in 10 points on how do I set up a budget?\nGenerated Output:\nSetting up a budget can help manage finances and save money. Here are some tips:\nDetermine your income and expenses.\nCreate a budget that includes all necessary expenses, such as rent, utilities, and groceries.\nSet aside a portion of your income for savings and investments.\nMonitor your spending regularly and adjust your budget as needed.\nUse cash or debit cards instead of credit cards to avoid overspending.\nCut back on unnecessary expenses, such as eating out or subscriptions.\nConsider using a budgeting app or tool to help track your spending.\nPrioritize your spending based on your financial goals.\nReview your budget regularly and make adjustments as needed.\nBe flexible and willing to make changes to your budget as your financial situation changes.\nTraining Details\nTraining Hyperparameters\nper_device_train_batch_size = 10\ngradient_accumulation_steps = 4\noptim = \"paged_adamw_32bit\"\nlearning_rate = 2e-4\nmax_grad_norm = 0.3\nwarmup_ratio = 0.03\nLicensing\nThe FinanceConnect model, developed by CeADAR Connect Group, combines the licensing frameworks of Llama2, FinTalk-8k and Alpaca.
