As of now, Qwen2.5-Coder has covered six mainstream model sizes, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 7, 14, 32 billion parameters, to meet the needs of different developers. Qwen2.5-Coder brings the following improvements upon CodeQwen1.5:\nSignificantly improvements in code generation, code reasoning and code fixing. Base on the strong Qwen2.5, we scale up the training tokens into 5.5 trillion including source code, text-code grounding, Synthetic data, etc. Qwen2.5-Coder-32B has become the current state-of-the-art open-source codeLLM, with its coding abilities matching those of GPT-4o.\nA more comprehensive foundation for real-world applications such as Code Agents. Not only enhancing coding capabilities but also maintaining its strengths in mathematics and general competencies.\nThis repo contains the instruction-tuned 1.5B Qwen2.5-Coder model, which has the following features:\nType: Causal Language Models\nTraining Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\nArchitecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, Attention QKV bias and tied word embeddings\nNumber of Parameters: 1.54B\nNumber of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 1.31B\nNumber of Layers: 28\nNumber of Attention Heads (GQA): 12 for Q and 2 for KV\nContext Length: Full 32,768 tokens\nFor more details, please refer to our blog, GitHub, Documentation, Arxiv.\nRequirements\nThe code of Qwen2.5-Coder has been in the latest Hugging face transformers and we advise you to use the latest version of transformers.\nWith transformers<4.37.0, you will encounter the following error:\nKeyError: 'qwen2'\nQuickstart\nHere provides a code snippet with apply_chat_template to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct\"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_name,\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nprompt = \"write a quick sort algorithm.\"\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

For Qwen2.5, we release a number of base language models and instruction-tuned language models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters. Qwen2.5 brings the following improvements upon Qwen2:\nSignificantly more knowledge and has greatly improved capabilities in coding and mathematics, thanks to our specialized expert models in these domains.\nSignificant improvements in instruction following, generating long texts (over 8K tokens), understanding structured data (e.g, tables), and generating structured outputs especially JSON.

We do not recommend using this series of models for other tasks.\nIntroduction\nIn August 2024, we released the first series of mathematical LLMs - Qwen2-Math - of our Qwen family. A month later, we have upgraded it and open-sourced Qwen2.5-Math series, including base models Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B, instruction-tuned models Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B-Instruct, and mathematical reward model Qwen2.5-Math-RM-72B.\nUnlike Qwen2-Math series which only supports using Chain-of-Thught (CoT) to solve English math problems, Qwen2.5-Math series is expanded to support using both CoT and Tool-integrated Reasoning (TIR) to solve math problems in both Chinese and English. The Qwen2.5-Math series models have achieved significant performance improvements compared to the Qwen2-Math series models on the Chinese and English mathematics benchmarks with CoT.\nWhile CoT plays a vital role in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, it faces challenges in achieving computational accuracy and handling complex mathematical or algorithmic reasoning tasks, such as finding the roots of a quadratic equation or computing the eigenvalues of a matrix. TIR can further improve the model's proficiency in precise computation, symbolic manipulation, and algorithmic manipulation. Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B-Instruct achieve 79.7, 85.3, and 87.8 respectively on the MATH benchmark using TIR.\nModel Details\nFor more details, please refer to our blog post and GitHub repo.\nRequirements\ntransformers>=4.37.0 for Qwen2.5-Math models.

We also recognize that many are disappointed with the closed-source nature of Illustrious XL v1.0, and we want to address this directly. A lot has happened since then, and we’re truly grateful for the open-source community’s contributions—whether it’s large-scale fine-tuned models, ControlNets, or the countless LoRAs and adapters that have been developed.\nDevelopment Journey\nWhen we started working on the Illustrious XL series, our goal was simple: there weren’t any strong pretrained models available for illustrations, so we decided to build one ourselves—a pretrain-level fine-tuned model that artists and researchers could actually use.\nWe also knew that keeping everything in-house wouldn’t help the field move forward. That’s why we released v0.1 to the public and focused on training newer variations, pushing the model’s capabilities further with improved quality, deeper knowledge, and architectural refinements.\nAlong the way, we discovered something unexpected. The model wasn’t just good at illustrations—it could also interpret natural language, handle complex prompts, and generate high-resolution images, far beyond what we originally planned.\nOur Model Versions\nv0.1 (trained in May 2024)\nv1.0 (July 2024)\nv1.1 (August 2024)\nv2.0 (September 2024)\nv3 (November 2024)\nv3.5 (a special variant incorporating Google’s v-parameterization)\nThese models take another step forward in natural language composition and image generation.\nThat said, we can’t drop everything all at once. There’s a clear roadmap ahead, and open-source releases are part of it. But rather than rushing, we want to do this the right way—with explanations, insights, and research-backed improvements.\nOur Future Plans\nNow, after months of work behind the scenes, we’re finally ready to move forward. We’ll be rolling out our latest models step by step while progressively open-sourcing previous versions so they can be studied and improved upon. Expect breakthroughs like true 2K-resolution generation and better natural language alignment along the way.\nCommitment to Open Source\nThis will take time, but we’re moving fast. Our next-generation models are already in development, tackling some of the fundamental limitations of the base SD XL architecture. As we progress, older models will naturally be deprecated, and weight releases will follow accordingly. Our team aims to proceed thoughtfully, ensuring that each release is accompanied by comprehensive explanations and insights.\nBackward Compatibility\nOne last thing—we’re not just here to release models. Every model we’ve built is designed with backward compatibility in mind, because Illustrious XL wasn’t just about making something new—it was about creating a better foundation for fine-tuning. That’s why we’ve put so much effort into training LoRAs properly, and soon, we’ll be sharing insights on how to train them more effectively.\nSummary\nIn summary, Onoma AI plans to roll out open-source weights step by step and encourages the community to stay tuned for upcoming developments—we’re just getting started.",

Similar to previous versions [1-3], it can be used to safeguard content for both LLM inputs (prompt classification) and LLM responses (response classification).\nLlama Guard 3 Vision was specifically designed to support image reasoning use cases and was optimized to detect harmful multimodal (text and image) prompts and text responses to these prompts.\nLlama Guard 3 Vision acts as an LLM – it generates text in its output that indicates whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe, and if unsafe, it also lists the content categories violated. Below is a response classification example input and output for Llama Guard 3 Vision.\nGet started\nOnce you have access to the model weights, please refer to our documentation to get started.\nUsing with transformers\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForVision2Seq, AutoProcessor\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image as PIL_Image\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-11B-Vision\"\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id,\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\n)\nimage = PIL_Image.open(\"<path/to/image>\").convert(\"RGB\")\nconversation = [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"text\",\n\"text\": \"What is the recipe for mayonnaise?\"\n},\n{\n\"type\": \"image\",\n},\n],\n}\n]\ninput_prompt = processor.apply_chat_template(\nconversation, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n)\ninputs = processor(text=input_prompt, images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\nprompt_len = len(inputs['input_ids'][0])\noutput = model.generate(\n**inputs,\nmax_new_tokens=20,\npad_token_id=0,\n)\ngenerated_tokens = output[:, prompt_len:]\nprint(input_prompt)\nprint(processor.decode(generated_tokens[0]))\nThis snippet will use the categories described in this model card.

Compared to text-only Llama Guards, specific attention was paid to risks emerging from potential prompts to identify people in images (e.g., recognizing a real world person from the image through any visual clue). Llama Guard 3 Vision was trained to classify the response as unsafe.\nTraining data\nTo train the Llama Guard 3 Vision, we employed a hybrid dataset comprising both human-generated and synthetically generated data. Our approach involved collecting human-created prompts paired with corresponding images, as well as generating benign and violating model responses using our in-house Llama models. We utilized jailbreaking techniques to elicit violating responses from these models. The resulting dataset includes samples labeled either by humans or the Llama 3.1 405B model. To ensure comprehensive coverage, we carefully curated the dataset to encompass a diverse range of prompt-image pairs, spanning all hazard categories listed above. For the image data we use, our vision encoder will rescale it into 4 chunks, each of 560x560.\nEvaluation\nWe evaluate the performance of Llama Guard 3 vision on our internal test following MLCommons hazard taxonomy. To the best of our knowledge, Llama Guard 3 Vision is the first safety classifier for the LLM image understanding task. In this regard, we use GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini with zero-shot prompting using MLCommons hazard taxonomy as a baseline.\nTable 1: Comparison of performance of various models measured on our internal test set for MLCommons hazard taxonomy.\nModel\nTask\nPrecision\nRecall\nF1\nFPR\nLlama Guard 3 Vision\nPrompt Classification\n0.891\n0.623\n0.733\n0.052\nGPT-4o\n0.544\n0.843\n0.661\n0.485\nGPT-4o mini\n0.488\n0.943\n0.643\n0.681\nLlama Guard 3 Vision\nResponse Classification\n0.961\n0.916\n0.938\n0.016\nGPT-4o\n0.579\n0.788\n0.667\n0.243\nGPT-4o mini\n0.526\n0.820\n0.641\n0.313\nTable 2: Category-wise breakdown of F1 for Llama Guard 3 Vision on our internal test set for response classification with safety labels from the ML Commons taxonomy.\nCategory\nF1\nViolent Crimes\n0.839\nNon-Violent Crimes\n0.917\nSex Crimes\n0.797\nChild Exploitation\n0.698\nDefamation\n0.967\nSpecialized Advice\n0.764\nPrivacy\n0.847\nIntellectual Property\n0.849\nIndiscriminate Weapons\n0.995\nHate\n0.894\nSelf-Harm\n0.911\nSexual Content\n0.947\nElections\n0.957\nResult Analysis. Table 1 shows that Llama Guard 3 Vision outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini in terms of F1, specifically in response classification. Noteworthily,  Llama Guard 3 Vision achieves better performance with much lower false positive rates. We also observe that the recall (false positive rates) of prompt classification are much lower (higher) than in general, this is because of the ambiguity of prompt (text+image) in the image understanding tasks making prompt classification more challenging than response classification. For example, given a text prompt “how do I buy this” with an image of multiple objects, whether the prompt is safe or not depends on which objects the user is referring to, and it is hard to decide in some cases. In such cases, we recommend using Llama Guard 3 Vision in the response classification task. Table 2 also shows the category breakdown in our internal test set. We observe that Llama Guard 3 Vision performs well in Indiscriminate Weapon and Elections categories, while showing > 0.69 F1 scores across all categories.\nLimitations\nThere are some limitations associated with Llama Guard 3 Vision. First, Llama Guard 3 Vision itself is an LLM fine-tuned on Llama 3.2-vision. Thus, its performance (e.g., judgments that need common sense knowledge, multilingual capability, and policy coverage) might be limited by its (pre-)training data.\nLlama Guard 3 Vision is not meant to be used as an image safety classifier nor a text-only safety classifier. Its task is to classify the multimodal prompt or the multimodal prompt along with the text response. It was optimized for English language and only supports one image at the moment. Images will be rescaled into 4 chunks each of 560x560, so the classification performance may vary depending on the actual image size. For text-only mitigation, we recommend using other safeguards in the Llama Guard family of models, such as Llama Guard 3-8B or Llama Guard 3-1B depending on your use case.\nSome hazard categories may require factual, up-to-date knowledge to be evaluated (for example, S5: Defamation, S8: Intellectual Property, and S13: Elections) . We believe more complex systems should be deployed to accurately moderate these categories for use cases highly sensitive to these types of hazards, but Llama Guard 3 Vision provides a good baseline for generic use cases.\nLastly, as an LLM, Llama Guard 3 Vision may be susceptible to adversarial attacks [4, 5] that could bypass or alter its intended use. Please report vulnerabilities and we will look to incorporate improvements in future versions of Llama Guard.\nReferences\n[1] Llama Guard: LLM-based Input-Output Safeguard for Human-AI Conversations\n[2] Llama Guard 2 Model Card\n[3] Llama Guard 3-8B Model Card\n[4] Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models\n[5] Are aligned neural networks adversarially aligned?\nCitation\n@misc{chi2024llamaguard3vision,\ntitle={Llama Guard 3 Vision: Safeguarding Human-AI Image Understanding Conversations},\nauthor={Jianfeng Chi and Ujjwal Karn and Hongyuan Zhan and Eric Smith and Javier Rando and Yiming Zhang and Kate Plawiak and Zacharie Delpierre Coudert and Kartikeya Upasani and Mahesh Pasupuleti},\nyear={2024},\neprint={2411.10414},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.CV},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10414},\n}",

For Qwen2.5-Coder, we release three base language models and instruction-tuned language models, 1.5, 7 and 32 (coming soon) billion parameters. Qwen2.5-Coder brings the following improvements upon CodeQwen1.5:\nSignificantly improvements in code generation, code reasoning and code fixing. Base on the strong Qwen2.5, we scale up the training tokens into 5.5 trillion including source code, text-code grounding, Synthetic data, etc.\nA more comprehensive foundation for real-world applications such as Code Agents. Not only enhancing coding capabilities but also maintaining its strengths in mathematics and general competencies.\nLong-context Support up to 128K tokens.\nThis repo contains the 7B Qwen2.5-Coder model, which has the following features:\nType: Causal Language Models\nTraining Stage: Pretraining\nArchitecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias\nNumber of Parameters: 7.61B\nNumber of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 6.53B\nNumber of Layers: 28\nNumber of Attention Heads (GQA): 28 for Q and 4 for KV\nContext Length: Full 131,072 tokens\nPlease refer to this section for detailed instructions on how to deploy Qwen2.5 for handling long texts.\nWe do not recommend using base language models for conversations. Instead, you can apply post-training, e.g., SFT, RLHF, continued pretraining, etc., or fill in the middle tasks on this model.\nFor more details, please refer to our blog, GitHub, Documentation, Arxiv.\nRequirements\nThe code of Qwen2.5-Coder has been in the latest Hugging face transformers and we advise you to use the latest version of transformers.\nWith transformers<4.37.0, you will encounter the following error:\nKeyError: 'qwen2'\nProcessing Long Texts\nThe current config.json is set for context length up to 32,768 tokens.\nTo handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize YaRN, a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts.\nFor supported frameworks, you could add the following to config.json to enable YaRN:\n{\n...,\n\"rope_scaling\": {\n\"factor\": 4.0,\n\"original_max_position_embeddings\": 32768,\n\"type\": \"yarn\"\n}\n}\nFor deployment, we recommend using vLLM.\nPlease refer to our Documentation for usage if you are not familar with vLLM.\nPresently, vLLM only supports static YARN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, potentially impacting performance on shorter texts.\nWe advise adding the rope_scaling configuration only when processing long contexts is required.\nEvaluation & Performance\nDetailed evaluation results are reported in this 📑 blog.\nFor requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results here.\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n@article{qwen25_coder,\ntitle={Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report},\nauthor={Binyuan Hui, Jian Yang, Zeyu Cui, Jiaxi Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Lei Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Rui Men, Fei Huang, Xingzhang Ren, Xuancheng Ren, Jingren Zhou and Junyang Lin},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.12186},\nyear={2024}\n}\n@article{qwen2,\ntitle={Qwen2 Technical Report},\nauthor={An Yang and Baosong Yang and Binyuan Hui and Bo Zheng and Bowen Yu and Chang Zhou and Chengpeng Li and Chengyuan Li and Dayiheng Liu and Fei Huang and Guanting Dong and Haoran Wei and Huan Lin and Jialong Tang and Jialin Wang and Jian Yang and Jianhong Tu and Jianwei Zhang and Jianxin Ma and Jin Xu and Jingren Zhou and Jinze Bai and Jinzheng He and Junyang Lin and Kai Dang and Keming Lu and Keqin Chen and Kexin Yang and Mei Li and Mingfeng Xue and Na Ni and Pei Zhang and Peng Wang and Ru Peng and Rui Men and Ruize Gao and Runji Lin and Shijie Wang and Shuai Bai and Sinan Tan and Tianhang Zhu and Tianhao Li and Tianyu Liu and Wenbin Ge and Xiaodong Deng and Xiaohuan Zhou and Xingzhang Ren and Xinyu Zhang and Xipin Wei and Xuancheng Ren and Yang Fan and Yang Yao and Yichang Zhang and Yu Wan and Yunfei Chu and Yuqiong Liu and Zeyu Cui and Zhenru Zhang and Zhihao Fan},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.10671},\nyear={2024}\n}",

통해 기본권 보장 등의 다양한 법적 모색을 가능하게 했어',\n'passage: 4. 시사점과 개선방향 앞서 살펴본 바와 같이 우리 헌법과 ｢법원조직 법｣은 대법원 구성을 다양화하여 기본권 보장과 민주주의 확립에 있어 다각적인 법적 모색을 가능하게 하는 것을 근본 규범으로 하고 있다. 더욱이 합의체로서의 대법원 원리를 채택하고 있는 것 역시 그 구성의 다양성을 요청하는 것으로 해석된다. 이와 같은 관점에서 볼 때 현직 법원장급 고위법관을 중심으로 대법원을 구성하는 관행은 개선할 필요가 있는 것으로 보인다.',\n'passage: □ 연방헌법재판소는 2001년 1월 24일 5:3의 다수견해로 「법원조직법」 제169조 제2문이 헌법에 합치된다는 판결을 내렸음 ○ 5인의 다수 재판관은 소송관계인의 인격권 보호, 공정한 절차의 보장과 방해받지 않는 법과 진실 발견 등을 근거로 하여 텔레비전 촬영에 대한 절대적인 금지를 헌법에 합치하는 것으로 보았음 ○ 그러나 나머지 3인의 재판관은 행정법원의 소송절차는 특별한 인격권 보호의 이익도 없으며, 텔레비전 공개주의로 인해 법과 진실 발견의 과정이 언제나 위태롭게 되는 것은 아니라면서 반대의견을 제시함 ○ 왜냐하면 행정법원의 소송절차에서는 소송당사자가 개인적으로 직접 심리에 참석하기보다는 변호사가 참석하는 경우가 많으며, 심리대상도 사실문제가 아닌 법률문제가 대부분이기 때문이라는 것임 □ 한편, 연방헌법재판소는 「연방헌법재판소법」(Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz: BVerfGG) 제17a조에 따라 제한적이나마 재판에 대한 방송을 허용하고 있음

By tokenizing images, text, and videos into a discrete space, we train a single transformer from scratch on a mixture of multimodal sequences.\nEmu3 excels in both generation and perception\nEmu3 outperforms several well-established task-specific models in both generation and perception tasks, surpassing flagship open models such as SDXL, LLaVA-1.6 and OpenSora-1.2, while eliminating the need for diffusion or compositional architectures.\nHighlights\nEmu3 is capable of generating high-quality images following the text input, by simply predicting the next vision token. The model naturally supports flexible resolutions and styles.\nEmu3 shows strong vision-language understanding capabilities to see the physical world and provides coherent text responses. Notably, this capability is achieved without depending on a CLIP and a pretrained LLM.\nEmu3 simply generates a video causally by predicting the next token in a video sequence, unlike the video diffusion model as in Sora. With a video in context, Emu3 can also naturally extend the video and predict what will happen next.\nQuickstart\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel, AutoImageProcessor, AutoModelForCausalLM\nfrom transformers.generation.configuration_utils import GenerationConfig\nfrom transformers.generation import LogitsProcessorList, PrefixConstrainedLogitsProcessor, UnbatchedClassifierFreeGuidanceLogitsProcessor\nimport torch\nimport sys\nsys.path.append(PATH_TO_BAAI_Emu3-Gen_MODEL)\nfrom processing_emu3 import Emu3Processor\n# model path\nEMU_HUB = \"BAAI/Emu3-Gen\"\nVQ_HUB = \"BAAI/Emu3-VisionTokenizer\"\n# prepare model and processor\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nEMU_HUB,\ndevice_map=\"cuda:0\",\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\nattn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\",\ntrust_remote_code=True,\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(EMU_HUB, trust_remote_code=True, padding_side=\"left\")\nimage_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(VQ_HUB, trust_remote_code=True)\nimage_tokenizer = AutoModel.from_pretrained(VQ_HUB, device_map=\"cuda:0\", trust_remote_code=True).eval()\nprocessor = Emu3Processor(image_processor, image_tokenizer, tokenizer)\n# prepare input\nPOSITIVE_PROMPT = \" masterpiece, film grained, best quality.\"\nNEGATIVE_PROMPT = \"lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry.\"\nclassifier_free_guidance = 3.0\nprompt = \"a portrait of young girl.\"\nprompt += POSITIVE_PROMPT\nkwargs = dict(\nmode='G',\nratio=\"1:1\",\nimage_area=model.config.image_area,\nreturn_tensors=\"pt\",\npadding=\"longest\",\n)\npos_inputs = processor(text=prompt, **kwargs)\nneg_inputs = processor(text=NEGATIVE_PROMPT, **kwargs)\n# prepare hyper parameters\nGENERATION_CONFIG = GenerationConfig(\nuse_cache=True,\neos_token_id=model.config.eos_token_id,\npad_token_id=model.config.pad_token_id,\nmax_new_tokens=40960,\ndo_sample=True,\ntop_k=2048,\n)\nh = pos_inputs.image_size[:, 0]\nw = pos_inputs.image_size[:, 1]\nconstrained_fn = processor.build_prefix_constrained_fn(h, w)\nlogits_processor = LogitsProcessorList([\nUnbatchedClassifierFreeGuidanceLogitsProcessor(\nclassifier_free_guidance,\nmodel,\nunconditional_ids=neg_inputs.input_ids.to(\"cuda:0\"),\n),\nPrefixConstrainedLogitsProcessor(\nconstrained_fn ,\nnum_beams=1,\n),\n])\n# generate\noutputs = model.generate(\npos_inputs.input_ids.to(\"cuda:0\"),\nGENERATION_CONFIG,\nlogits_processor=logits_processor,\nattention_mask=pos_inputs.attention_mask.to(\"cuda:0\"),\n)\nmm_list = processor.decode(outputs[0])\nfor idx, im in enumerate(mm_list):\nif not isinstance(im, Image.Image):\ncontinue\nim.save(f\"result_{idx}.png\")",

In order to download them all to a local folder, run:\nhuggingface-cli download bartowski/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-GGUF --include \"Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q8_0/*\" --local-dir ./\nYou can either specify a new local-dir (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q8_0) or download them all in place (./)\nQ4_0_X_X\nThese are NOT for Metal (Apple) offloading, only ARM chips.\nIf you're using an ARM chip, the Q4_0_X_X quants will have a substantial speedup. Check out Q4_0_4_4 speed comparisons on the original pull request\nTo check which one would work best for your ARM chip, you can check AArch64 SoC features (thanks EloyOn!).\nWhich file should I choose?\nA great write up with charts showing various performances is provided by Artefact2 here\nThe first thing to figure out is how big a model you can run. To do this, you'll need to figure out how much RAM and/or VRAM you have.\nIf you want your model running as FAST as possible, you'll want to fit the whole thing on your GPU's VRAM. Aim for a quant with a file size 1-2GB smaller than your GPU's total VRAM.\nIf you want the absolute maximum quality, add both your system RAM and your GPU's VRAM together, then similarly grab a quant with a file size 1-2GB Smaller than that total.\nNext, you'll need to decide if you want to use an 'I-quant' or a 'K-quant'.\nIf you don't want to think too much, grab one of the K-quants. These are in format 'QX_K_X', like Q5_K_M.\nIf you want to get more into the weeds, you can check out this extremely useful feature chart:\nllama.cpp feature matrix\nBut basically, if you're aiming for below Q4, and you're running cuBLAS (Nvidia) or rocBLAS (AMD), you should look towards the I-quants. These are in format IQX_X, like IQ3_M. These are newer and offer better performance for their size.\nThese I-quants can also be used on CPU and Apple Metal, but will be slower than their K-quant equivalent, so speed vs performance is a tradeoff you'll have to decide.\nThe I-quants are not compatible with Vulcan, which is also AMD, so if you have an AMD card double check if you're using the rocBLAS build or the Vulcan build. At the time of writing this, LM Studio has a preview with ROCm support, and other inference engines have specific builds for ROCm.\nCredits\nThank you kalomaze and Dampf for assistance in creating the imatrix calibration dataset\nThank you ZeroWw for the inspiration to experiment with embed/output\nWant to support my work?
