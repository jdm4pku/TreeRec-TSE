Hmm, where do I even start? I remember from school that adding numbers is pretty basic, but I want to make sure I understand it properly.\nLet me think, 1 plus 1. So, I have one item and I add another one. Maybe like a apple plus another apple. If I have one apple and someone gives me another, I now have two apples. So, 1 plus 1 should be 2. That makes sense.\nWait, but sometimes math can be tricky. Could it be something else? Like, in a different number system maybe? But I think the question is straightforward, using regular numbers, not like binary or hexadecimal or anything.\nI also recall that in arithmetic, addition is combining quantities. So, if you have two quantities of 1, combining them gives you a total of 2. Yeah, that seems right.\nIs there a scenario where 1 plus 1 wouldn't be 2? I can't think of any...\nIf you have a GPU (RTX 4090 for example) with 24GB, you can offload multiple layers to the GPU for faster processing. If you have multiple GPUs, you can probably offload more layers.\n./llama.cpp/llama-cli \\\n--model unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B-GGUF/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B-Q4_K_M.gguf\n--cache-type-k q8_0\n--threads 16\n--prompt '<｜User｜>What is 1+1?<｜Assistant｜>'\n--n-gpu-layers 20 \\\n-no-cnv\nFinetune LLMs 2-5x faster with 70% less memory via Unsloth!\nWe have a free Google Colab Tesla T4 notebook for Llama 3.1 (8B) here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Llama3.1_(8B)-Alpaca.ipynb\n✨ Finetune for Free\nAll notebooks are beginner friendly!

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1.\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.\nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n3.

So, I have one item and I add another one. Maybe like a apple plus another apple. If I have one apple and someone gives me another, I now have two apples. So, 1 plus 1 should be 2.

But I think the question is straightforward, using regular numbers, not like binary or hexadecimal or anything.\nI also recall that in arithmetic, addition is combining quantities.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1.\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.\nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n3.

We have released a range of base language models and instruction-tuned language models, spanning from 0.5 billion to 72 billion parameters. Qwen2.5 introduces the following improvements over Qwen2:\nSignificantly enhanced knowledge and greatly improved capabilities in coding and mathematics, thanks to specialized expert models in these domains.\nMajor improvements in instruction following, generating long texts (over 8K tokens), understanding structured data (e.g., tables), and generating structured outputs, especially JSON. It is more resilient to diverse system prompts, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots.\nLong-context support for up to 128K tokens and the ability to generate outputs up to 8K tokens.\nMultilingual support for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more.\nArchitecture: Transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, Attention QKV bias, and tied word embeddings.\nQuickstart with Transformer\nHere provides a code snippet with apply_chat_template to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nmodel_name = \"prithivMLmods/FastThink-0.5B-Tiny\"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_name,\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nprompt = \"Give me a short introduction to large language model.\"\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n**model_inputs,\nmax_new_tokens=512\n)\ngenerated_ids = [\noutput_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)\n]\nresponse = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\nDataset Preparation\nThis script is designed to load, process, and combine multiple datasets into a single, standardized format suitable for training conversational AI models. The script uses the datasets library to load and manipulate the datasets, and the chat_templates library to standardize the conversation format.\nExample\n# Load the initial three datasets\ndataset1 = load_dataset(\"PowerInfer/LONGCOT-Refine-500K\", split=\"train\")\ndataset2 = load_dataset(\"amphora/QwQ-LongCoT-130K\", split=\"train\")\ndataset3 = load_dataset(\"AI-MO/NuminaMath-CoT\", split=\"train\")\n# Map conversation columns for all datasets\ndataset1 = dataset1.map(add_conversations_column, batched=False)\ndataset2 = dataset2.map(add_conversations_column_prompt_qwq, batched=False)\ndataset3 = dataset3.map(add_conversations_column_prompt_solution, batched=False)\n# Combine all datasets\ncombined_dataset = concatenate_datasets([dataset1, dataset2, dataset3])\n# Standardize using the ShareGPT format\ncombined_dataset = standardize_sharegpt(combined_dataset)\n# Initialize the tokenizer with a specific chat template\ntokenizer = get_chat_template(tokenizer, chat_template=\"qwen-2.5\")\n# Apply formatting function to the combined dataset\ncombined_dataset = combined_dataset.map(formatting_prompts_func, batched=True)\n# Print the first few examples to verify the output\nprint(combined_dataset[:50000])\nIntended Use\nReasoning Tasks: FastThink-0.5B-Tiny is optimized for reasoning-focused applications, such as logical problem-solving, decision-making, and analytical workflows.\nInstruction Following: Ideal for scenarios where precise adherence to instructions is required, including generating structured outputs like JSON or tables.\nMultilingual Support: Suitable for use in multilingual environments, supporting over 29 languages, making it versatile for global applications.\nCoding and Mathematics: Highly effective in tasks involving coding, debugging, or solving mathematical problems, leveraging expert domain knowledge.\nRole-play Scenarios: Can simulate conversational agents or personas for role-playing, enhancing chatbot and virtual assistant implementations.\nLong-form Content Creation: Designed to generate and manage long-form text (up to 8K tokens) while maintaining context, making it ideal for tasks like report writing or storytelling.\nUnderstanding and Processing Structured Data: Efficient at interpreting and working with structured data, such as tables or hierarchical formats.\nLow-Resource Applications: With a smaller parameter size (0.5B), it is well-suited for applications with limited computational resources or edge deployment.\nLimitations\nLimited Model Size: As a 0.5B-parameter model, its reasoning and comprehension capabilities are less advanced compared to larger models, particularly for highly complex tasks.\nContextual Limitations: Although it supports a context length of up to 128K tokens, its ability to effectively utilize such a long context may vary, particularly in tasks requiring intricate cross-referencing of earlier inputs.\nAccuracy in Domain-Specific Tasks: While capable in coding and mathematics, it may struggle with highly specialized or esoteric domain knowledge compared to models fine-tuned specifically for those areas.\nAmbiguity Handling: May misinterpret vague or poorly structured prompts, leading to less accurate or unintended results.\nLong-Context Tradeoffs: Generating or processing very long outputs (e.g., close to the 8K token limit) could result in decreased coherence or relevance toward the end.\nMultilingual Performance: Although it supports 29 languages, its proficiency and fluency may vary across languages, with some underrepresented languages possibly seeing reduced performance.\nResource-Intensive for Long Contexts: Using its long-context capabilities (128K tokens) can be computationally demanding, requiring significant memory and processing power.\nDependence on Fine-Tuning: For highly specialized tasks or domains, additional fine-tuning may be necessary to achieve optimal performance.",

Unlike traditional modular frameworks, UI-TARS integrates all key components—perception, reasoning, grounding, and memory—within a single vision-language model (VLM), enabling end-to-end task automation without predefined workflows or manual rules.\nThis repository contains the model for the paper UI-TARS: Pioneering Automated GUI Interaction with Native Agents.\nCode:

The training of the model relies on an efficient training approach proposed by the Kwaipilot team. By incorporating techniques such as model pruning, knowledge distillation, and fine-grained merging, the training of the 23B-wide MoE architecture code completion model was achieved at 1/30 of the cost compared to traditional methods.

    "Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M": "Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M\nIntroduction\nRequirements\nQuickstart\nProcessing Ultra Long Texts\nEvaluation & Performance\nCitation\nQwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M\nIntroduction\nQwen2.5-1M is the long-context version of the Qwen2.5 series models, supporting a context length of up to 1M tokens. Compared to the Qwen2.5 128K version, Qwen2.5-1M demonstrates significantly improved performance in handling long-context tasks while maintaining its capability in short tasks.\nThe model has the following features:\nType: Causal Language Models\nTraining Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\nArchitecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias\nNumber of Parameters: 14.7B\nNumber of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 13.1B\nNumber of Layers: 48\nNumber of Attention Heads (GQA): 40 for Q and 8 for KV\nContext Length: Full 1,010,000 tokens and generation 8192 tokens\nWe recommend deploying with our custom vLLM, which introduces sparse attention and length extrapolation methods to ensure efficiency and accuracy for long-context tasks. For specific guidance, refer to this section.\nYou can also use the previous framework that supports Qwen2.5 for inference, but accuracy degradation may occur for sequences exceeding 262,144 tokens.\nFor more details, please refer to our blog, GitHub, Technical Report, and Documentation.\nRequirements\nThe code of Qwen2.5 has been in the latest Hugging face transformers and we advise you to use the latest version of transformers.\nWith transformers<4.37.0, you will encounter the following error:\nKeyError: 'qwen2'\nQuickstart\nHere provides a code snippet with apply_chat_template to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M\"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_name,\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nprompt = \"Give me a short introduction to large language model.\"\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

This approach significantly improves model generation performance for sequences exceeding 256K tokens and achieves a 3 to 7 times speedup for sequences up to 1M tokens.\nHere we provide step-by-step instructions for deploying the Qwen2.5-1M models with our framework.\n1. System Preparation\nTo achieve the best performance, we recommend using GPUs with Ampere or Hopper architecture, which support optimized kernels.\nEnsure your system meets the following requirements:\nCUDA Version: 12.1 or 12.3\nPython Version: >=3.9 and <=3.12\nVRAM Requirements:\nFor processing 1 million-token sequences:\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M: At least 120GB VRAM (total across GPUs).\nQwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M: At least 320GB VRAM (total across GPUs).\nIf your GPUs do not have sufficient VRAM, you can still use Qwen2.5-1M for shorter tasks.\n2. Install Dependencies\nFor now, you need to clone the vLLM repository from our custom branch and install it manually. We are working on getting our branch merged into the main vLLM project.\ngit clone -b dev/dual-chunk-attn git@github.com:QwenLM/vllm.git\ncd vllm\npip install -e . -v\n3.

Max 4 GPUs for the 7B model, and 8 GPUs for the 14B model.\n--max-model-len\nDefines the maximum input sequence length. Reduce this value if you encounter Out of Memory issues.\n--max-num-batched-tokens\nSets the chunk size in Chunked Prefill. A smaller value reduces activation memory usage but may slow down inference.\nRecommend 131072 for optimal performance.\n--max-num-seqs\nLimits concurrent sequences processed.\nYou can also refer to our Documentation for usage of vLLM.\nTroubleshooting:\nEncountering the error: \"The model's max sequence length (xxxxx) is larger than the maximum number of tokens that can be stored in the KV cache.\"\nThe VRAM reserved for the KV cache is insufficient. Consider reducing the max_model_len or increasing the tensor_parallel_size. Alternatively, you can reduce max_num_batched_tokens, although this may significantly slow down inference.\nEncountering the error: \"torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory.\"\nThe VRAM reserved for activation weights is insufficient. You can try setting gpu_memory_utilization to 0.85 or lower, but be aware that this might reduce the VRAM available for the KV cache.\nEncountering the error: \"Input prompt (xxxxx tokens) + lookahead slots (0) is too long and exceeds the capacity of the block manager.\"\nThe input is too lengthy. Consider using a shorter sequence or increasing the max_model_len.\nEvaluation & Performance\nDetailed evaluation results are reported in this 📑 blog and our technical report.\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n@misc{qwen2.5-1m,\ntitle = {Qwen2.5-1M: Deploy Your Own Qwen with Context Length up to 1M Tokens},\nurl = {https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-1m/},\nauthor = {Qwen Team},\nmonth = {January},\nyear = {2025}\n}\n@article{qwen2.5,\ntitle={Qwen2.5-1M Technical Report},\nauthor={An Yang and Bowen Yu and Chengyuan Li and Dayiheng Liu and Fei Huang and Haoyan Huang and Jiandong Jiang and Jianhong Tu and Jianwei Zhang and Jingren Zhou and Junyang Lin and Kai Dang and Kexin Yang and Le Yu and Mei Li and Minmin Sun and Qin Zhu and Rui Men and Tao He and Weijia Xu and Wenbiao Yin and Wenyuan Yu and Xiafei Qiu and Xingzhang Ren and Xinlong Yang and Yong Li and Zhiying Xu and Zipeng Zhang},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2501.15383},\nyear={2025}\n}",

If there are significant differences in utterance lengths, shorter utterances may experience repetition issues. You can either sort your dataset by length or set batch_size to 1 to avoid the repetition issue.\nInput Length Limitations\nFireRedASR-AED supports audio input up to 60s. Input longer than 60s may cause hallucination issues, and input exceeding 200s will trigger positional encoding errors.\nFireRedASR-LLM supports audio input up to 30s. The behavior for longer input is currently unknown.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to the following open-source works:\nQwen2-7B-Instruct\nicefall/ASR_LLM\nWeNet\nSpeech-Transformer",

In Chinese, the word means \"music\" and \"happiness.\" Some of you may find words that start with Yu hard to pronounce. If so, you can just call it \"yeah.\" We wrote a song with our model's name.\nYuE is a groundbreaking series of open-source foundation models designed for music generation, specifically for transforming lyrics into full songs (lyrics2song). It can generate a complete song, lasting several minutes, that includes both a catchy vocal track and accompaniment track. YuE is capable of modeling diverse genres/languages/vocal techniques. Please visit the Demo Page for amazing vocal performance.\nPop:Quiet Evening\nMetal: Step Back\nNews and Updates\n📌 Join Us on Discord!\n2025.03.12 🔥 Paper Released🎉: We now release YuE technical report!!! We discuss all the technical details, findings, and lessons learned. Enjoy, and feel free to cite us~\n2025.03.11 🫶 Now YuE supports incremental song generation!!! See YuE-UI by joeljuvel. YuE-UI is a Gradio-based interface supporting batch generation, output selection, and continuation. You can flexibly experiment with audio prompts and different model settings, visualize your progress on an interactive timeline, rewind actions, quickly preview audio outputs at stage 1 before committing to refinement, and fully save/load your sessions (JSON format). Optimized to run smoothly even on GPUs with just 8GB VRAM using quantized models.\n2025.02.17 🫶 Now YuE supports music continuation and Google Colab! See YuE-extend by Mozer.\n2025.02.07 🎉 Get YuE for Windows on pinokio.\n2025.01.30 🔥 Inference Update: We now support dual-track ICL mode! You can prompt the model with a reference song, and it will generate a new song in a similar style (voice cloning demo by @abrakjamson, music style transfer demo by @cocktailpeanut, etc.). Try it out! 🔥🔥🔥 P.S. Be sure to check out the demos first—they're truly impressive.\n2025.01.30 🔥 Announcement: A New Era Under Apache 2.0 🔥: We are thrilled to announce that, in response to overwhelming requests from our community, YuE is now officially licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. We sincerely hope this marks a watershed moment—akin to what Stable Diffusion and LLaMA have achieved in their respective fields—for music generation and creative AI. 🎉🎉🎉\n2025.01.29 🎉: We have updated the license description. we ENCOURAGE artists and content creators to sample and incorporate outputs generated by our model into their own works, and even monetize them.
