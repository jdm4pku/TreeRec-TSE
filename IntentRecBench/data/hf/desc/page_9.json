The Llama 3 instruction tuned models are optimized for dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source chat models on common industry benchmarks. Further, in developing these models, we took great care to optimize helpfulness and safety.\nModel developers Meta\nVariations Llama 3 comes in two sizes — 8B and 70B parameters — in pre-trained and instruction tuned variants.\nInput Models input text only.\nOutput Models generate text and code only.\nModel Architecture Llama 3 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\nTraining Data\nParams\nContext length\nGQA\nToken count\nKnowledge cutoff\nLlama 3\nA new mix of publicly available online data.\n8B\n8k\nYes\n15T+\nMarch, 2023\n70B\n8k\nYes\nDecember, 2023\nLlama 3 family of models. Token counts refer to pretraining data only. Both the 8 and 70B versions use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\nModel Release Date April 18, 2024.\nStatus This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\nLicense A custom commercial license is available at: https://llama.meta.com/llama3/license\nWhere to send questions or comments about the model Instructions on how to provide feedback or comments on the model can be found in the model README. For more technical information about generation parameters and recipes for how to use Llama 3 in applications, please go here.\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases Llama 3 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Instruction tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\nOut-of-scope Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3 Community License. Use in languages other than English**.\n**Note: Developers may fine-tune Llama 3 models for languages beyond English provided they comply with the Llama 3 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy.\nHow to use\nThis repository contains two versions of Meta-Llama-3-8B, for use with transformers and with the original llama3 codebase.\nUse with transformers\nSee the snippet below for usage with Transformers:\n>>> import transformers\n>>> import torch\n>>> model_id = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B\"\n>>> pipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n\"text-generation\", model=model_id, model_kwargs={\"torch_dtype\": torch.bfloat16}, device_map=\"auto\"\n)\n>>> pipeline(\"Hey how are you doing today?\")\nUse with llama3\nPlease, follow the instructions in the repository.\nTo download Original checkpoints, see the example command below leveraging huggingface-cli:\nhuggingface-cli download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B --include \"original/*\" --local-dir Meta-Llama-3-8B\nFor Hugging Face support, we recommend using transformers or TGI, but a similar command works.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research SuperCluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\nCarbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 7.7M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type H100-80GB (TDP of 700W). Estimated total emissions were 2290 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\nTime (GPU hours)\nPower Consumption (W)\nCarbon Emitted(tCO2eq)\nLlama 3 8B\n1.3M\n700\n390\nLlama 3 70B\n6.4M\n700\n1900\nTotal\n7.7M\n2290\nCO2 emissions during pre-training. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview Llama 3 was pretrained on over 15 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over 10M human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\nData Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of March 2023 for the 8B and December 2023 for the 70B models respectively.\nBenchmarks\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 3 models on standard automatic benchmarks. For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.

We are committed to Responsible AI development and took a series of steps to limit misuse and harm and support the open source community.\nFoundation models are widely capable technologies that are built to be used for a diverse range of applications. They are not designed to meet every developer preference on safety levels for all use cases, out-of-the-box, as those by their nature will differ across different applications.\nRather, responsible LLM-application deployment is achieved by implementing a series of safety best practices throughout the development of such applications, from the model pre-training, fine-tuning and the deployment of systems composed of safeguards to tailor the safety needs specifically to the use case and audience.\nAs part of the Llama 3 release, we updated our Responsible Use Guide to outline the steps and best practices for developers to implement model and system level safety for their application. We also provide a set of resources including Meta Llama Guard 2 and Code Shield safeguards. These tools have proven to drastically reduce residual risks of LLM Systems, while maintaining a high level of helpfulness. We encourage developers to tune and deploy these safeguards according to their needs and we provide a reference implementation to get you started.\nLlama 3-Instruct\nAs outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, some trade-off between model helpfulness and model alignment is likely unavoidable. Developers should exercise discretion about how to weigh the benefits of alignment and helpfulness for their specific use case and audience. Developers should be mindful of residual risks when using Llama models and leverage additional safety tools as needed to reach the right safety bar for their use case.\nSafety\nFor our instruction tuned model, we conducted extensive red teaming exercises, performed adversarial evaluations and implemented safety mitigations techniques to lower residual risks. As with any Large Language Model, residual risks will likely remain and we recommend that developers assess these risks in the context of their use case. In parallel, we are working with the community to make AI safety benchmark standards transparent, rigorous and interpretable.\nRefusals\nIn addition to residual risks, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts. Over-refusing not only can impact the user experience but could even be harmful in certain contexts as well. We’ve heard the feedback from the developer community and improved our fine tuning to ensure that Llama 3 is significantly less likely to falsely refuse to answer prompts than Llama 2.\nWe built internal benchmarks and developed mitigations to limit false refusals making Llama 3 our most helpful model to date.\nResponsible release\nIn addition to responsible use considerations outlined above, we followed a rigorous process that requires us to take extra measures against misuse and critical risks before we make our release decision.\nMisuse\nIf you access or use Llama 3, you agree to the Acceptable Use Policy. The most recent copy of this policy can be found at https://llama.meta.com/llama3/use-policy/.\nCritical risks\nCBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives)\nWe have conducted a two fold assessment of the safety of the model in this area:\nIterative testing during model training to assess the safety of responses related to CBRNE threats and other adversarial risks.\nInvolving external CBRNE experts to conduct an uplift test assessing the ability of the model to accurately provide expert knowledge and reduce barriers to potential CBRNE misuse, by reference to what can be achieved using web search (without the model).\nCyber Security\nWe have evaluated Llama 3 with CyberSecEval, Meta’s cybersecurity safety eval suite, measuring Llama 3’s propensity to suggest insecure code when used as a coding assistant, and Llama 3’s propensity to comply with requests to help carry out cyber attacks, where attacks are defined by the industry standard MITRE ATT&CK cyber attack ontology. On our insecure coding and cyber attacker helpfulness tests, Llama 3 behaved in the same range or safer than models of equivalent coding capability.\nChild Safety\nChild Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development.  For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\nCommunity\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership in AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nThe core values of Llama 3 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nBut Llama 3 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. As outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, we recommend incorporating Purple Llama solutions into your workflows and specifically Llama Guard which provides a base model to filter input and output prompts to layer system-level safety on top of model-level safety.\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at http://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide\nCitation instructions\n@article{llama3modelcard,\ntitle={Llama 3 Model Card},\nauthor={AI@Meta},\nyear={2024},\nurl = {https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md}\n}\nContributors\nAaditya Singh;

images, we support local files, base64, and URLs. For videos, we currently only support local files.\n# You can directly insert a local file path, a URL, or a base64-encoded image into the position where you want in the text.\n## Local file path\nmessages = [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"image\", \"image\": \"file:///path/to/your/image.jpg\"},\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image.\"},\n],\n}\n]\n## Image URL\nmessages = [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"image\", \"image\": \"http://path/to/your/image.jpg\"},\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image.\"},\n],\n}\n]\n## Base64 encoded image\nmessages = [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"image\", \"image\": \"data:image;base64,/9j/...\"},\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image.\"},\n],\n}\n]\nImage Resolution for performance boost\nThe model supports a wide range of resolution inputs. By default, it uses the native resolution for input, but higher resolutions can enhance performance at the cost of more computation. Users can set the minimum and maximum number of pixels to achieve an optimal configuration for their needs, such as a token count range of 256-1280, to balance speed and memory usage.\nmin_pixels = 256 * 28 * 28\nmax_pixels = 1280 * 28 * 28\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\n\"Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct\", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels\n)\nBesides, We provide two methods for fine-grained control over the image size input to the model:\nDefine min_pixels and max_pixels: Images will be resized to maintain their aspect ratio within the range of min_pixels and max_pixels.\nSpecify exact dimensions: Directly set resized_height and resized_width. These values will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 28.\n# min_pixels and max_pixels\nmessages = [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"image\",\n\"image\": \"file:///path/to/your/image.jpg\",\n\"resized_height\": 280,\n\"resized_width\": 420,\n},\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image.\"},\n],\n}\n]\n# resized_height and resized_width\nmessages = [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"image\",\n\"image\": \"file:///path/to/your/image.jpg\",\n\"min_pixels\": 50176,\n\"max_pixels\": 50176,\n},\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image.\"},\n],\n}\n]\nLimitations\nWhile Qwen2-VL are applicable to a wide range of visual tasks, it is equally important to understand its limitations. Here are some known restrictions:\nLack of Audio Support: The current model does not comprehend audio information within videos.\nData timeliness: Our image dataset is updated until June 2023, and information subsequent to this date may not be covered.\nConstraints in Individuals and Intellectual Property (IP): The model's capacity to recognize specific individuals or IPs is limited, potentially failing to comprehensively cover all well-known personalities or brands.\nLimited Capacity for Complex Instruction: When faced with intricate multi-step instructions, the model's understanding and execution capabilities require enhancement.\nInsufficient Counting Accuracy: Particularly in complex scenes, the accuracy of object counting is not high, necessitating further improvements.\nWeak Spatial Reasoning Skills: Especially in 3D spaces, the model's inference of object positional relationships is inadequate, making it difficult to precisely judge the relative positions of objects.\nThese limitations serve as ongoing directions for model optimization and improvement, and we are committed to continually enhancing the model's performance and scope of application.\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n@article{Qwen2VL,\ntitle={Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model's Perception of the World at Any Resolution},\nauthor={Wang, Peng and Bai, Shuai and Tan, Sinan and Wang, Shijie and Fan, Zhihao and Bai, Jinze and Chen, Keqin and Liu, Xuejing and Wang, Jialin and Ge, Wenbin and Fan, Yang and Dang, Kai and Du, Mengfei and Ren, Xuancheng and Men, Rui and Liu, Dayiheng and Zhou, Chang and Zhou, Jingren and Lin, Junyang},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.12191},\nyear={2024}\n}\n@article{Qwen-VL,\ntitle={Qwen-VL: A Versatile Vision-Language Model for Understanding, Localization, Text Reading, and Beyond},\nauthor={Bai, Jinze and Bai, Shuai and Yang, Shusheng and Wang, Shijie and Tan, Sinan and Wang, Peng and Lin, Junyang and Zhou, Chang and Zhou, Jingren},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.12966},\nyear={2023}\n}",

It introduces a streaming encoder-decoder architecture with quantized latent space, trained in an end-to-end fashion.\nIt was trained on speech data, which makes it particularly adapted to train speech language models or text-to-speech systems.\nDeveloped by:  Kyutai\nModel type: Audio codec\nAudio types: Speech\nLicense: CC-BY\nModel Sources\nRepository: repo\nPaper: paper\nDemo: demo\nUses\nHow to Get Started with the Model\nUsage with transformers\nUse the following code to get started with the Mimi model using a dummy example from the LibriSpeech dataset (~9MB). First, install the required Python packages:\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --upgrade datasets[audio]\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git@main\nThen load an audio sample, and run a forward pass of the model:\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, Audio\nfrom transformers import MimiModel, AutoFeatureExtractor\n# load a demonstration datasets\nlibrispeech_dummy = load_dataset(\"hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\n# load the model + feature extractor (for pre-processing the audio)\nmodel = MimiModel.from_pretrained(\"kyutai/mimi\")\nfeature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\"kyutai/mimi\")\n# cast the audio data to the correct sampling rate for the model\nlibrispeech_dummy = librispeech_dummy.cast_column(\"audio\", Audio(sampling_rate=feature_extractor.sampling_rate))\naudio_sample = librispeech_dummy[0][\"audio\"][\"array\"]\n# pre-process the inputs\ninputs = feature_extractor(raw_audio=audio_sample, sampling_rate=feature_extractor.sampling_rate, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n# explicitly encode then decode the audio inputs\nencoder_outputs = model.encode(inputs[\"input_values\"])\naudio_values = model.decode(encoder_outputs.audio_codes)[0]\n# or the equivalent with a forward pass\naudio_values = model(inputs[\"input_values\"]).audio_values\nUsage with Moshi\nSee the main README file.\nDirect Use\nMimi can be used directly as an audio codec for real-time compression and decompression of speech signals.\nIt provides high-quality audio compression and efficient decoding.\nOut-of-Scope Use\nThe model is not intended to be used to impersonate other people or any malicious use of any kind.\nBias, Risks, and Limitations\nThe model has been trained with a few safeguards to try to limit potential toxic usages, however our toxicity analysis shows that it behaves in the middle of existing models with respect to textual generation. It has some bias towards certain domains and topics that are over-represented in the training data. Its capabilities are relatively limited so far and it is trained to produce only one voice to avoid impersonation. Yet, we need the perspective in time to establish the sociotechnical limitations.\nTraining Details\nTraining Data\nThe training data is detailled in the paper.\nTraining procedure and hyper-parameters\nThe different stages of the training procedure are detailled in the paper along with the hyper-parameters.\nCitation\n@techreport{kyutai2024moshi,\nauthor = {Alexandre D\\'efossez and Laurent Mazar\\'e and Manu Orsini and Am\\'elie Royer and Patrick P\\'erez and Herv\\'e J\\'egou and Edouard Grave and Neil Zeghidour},\ntitle = {Moshi: a speech-text foundation model for real-time dialogue},\ninstitution = {Kyutai},\nyear={2024},\nmonth={September},\nurl={http://kyutai.org/Moshi.pdf},\n}\nModel Card Authors\nAlexandre Défossez, Laurent Mazaré, Manu Orsini, Amélie Royer, Patrick Pérez, Hervé Jégou, Edouard Grave, Neil Zeghidour, Yoach Lacombe",

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1.\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.\nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n3.

During this period, we focused on building more useful vision-language models. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Qwen family: Qwen2.5-VL.\nKey Enhancements:\nUnderstand things visually: Qwen2.5-VL is not only proficient in recognizing common objects such as flowers, birds, fish, and insects, but it is highly capable of analyzing texts, charts, icons, graphics, and layouts within images.\nBeing agentic: Qwen2.5-VL directly plays as a visual agent that can reason and dynamically direct tools, which is capable of computer use and phone use.\nUnderstanding long videos and capturing events: Qwen2.5-VL can comprehend videos of over 1 hour, and this time it has a new ability of cpaturing event by pinpointing the relevant video segments.\nCapable of visual localization in different formats: Qwen2.5-VL can accurately localize objects in an image by generating bounding boxes or points, and it can provide stable JSON outputs for coordinates and attributes.\nGenerating structured outputs: for data like scans of invoices, forms, tables, etc. Qwen2.5-VL supports structured outputs of their contents, benefiting usages in finance, commerce, etc.\nModel Architecture Updates:\nDynamic Resolution and Frame Rate Training for Video Understanding:\nWe extend dynamic resolution to the temporal dimension by adopting dynamic FPS sampling, enabling the model to comprehend videos at various sampling rates. Accordingly, we update mRoPE in the time dimension with IDs and absolute time alignment, enabling the model to learn temporal sequence and speed, and ultimately acquire the ability to pinpoint specific moments.\nStreamlined and Efficient Vision Encoder\nWe enhance both training and inference speeds by strategically implementing window attention into the ViT. The ViT architecture is further optimized with SwiGLU and RMSNorm, aligning it with the structure of the Qwen2.5 LLM.\nWe have three models with 3, 7 and 72 billion parameters. This repo contains the instruction-tuned 3B Qwen2.5-VL model.

By default, it uses the native resolution for input, but higher resolutions can enhance performance at the cost of more computation. Users can set the minimum and maximum number of pixels to achieve an optimal configuration for their needs, such as a token count range of 256-1280, to balance speed and memory usage.\nmin_pixels = 256 * 28 * 28\nmax_pixels = 1280 * 28 * 28\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\n\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct\", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels\n)\nBesides, We provide two methods for fine-grained control over the image size input to the model:\nDefine min_pixels and max_pixels: Images will be resized to maintain their aspect ratio within the range of min_pixels and max_pixels.\nSpecify exact dimensions: Directly set resized_height and resized_width. These values will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 28.\n# min_pixels and max_pixels\nmessages = [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"image\",\n\"image\": \"file:///path/to/your/image.jpg\",\n\"resized_height\": 280,\n\"resized_width\": 420,\n},\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image.\"},\n],\n}\n]\n# resized_height and resized_width\nmessages = [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"image\",\n\"image\": \"file:///path/to/your/image.jpg\",\n\"min_pixels\": 50176,\n\"max_pixels\": 50176,\n},\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image.\"},\n],\n}\n]\nProcessing Long Texts\nThe current config.json is set for context length up to 32,768 tokens.\nTo handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize YaRN, a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts.\nFor supported frameworks, you could add the following to config.json to enable YaRN:\n{\n...,\n\"type\": \"yarn\",\n\"mrope_section\": [\n16,\n24,\n24\n],\n\"factor\": 4,\n\"original_max_position_embeddings\": 32768\n}\nHowever, it should be noted that this method has a significant impact on the performance of temporal and spatial localization tasks, and is therefore not recommended for use.\nAt the same time, for long video inputs, since MRoPE itself is more economical with ids, the max_position_embeddings can be directly modified to a larger value, such as 64k.\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n@misc{qwen2.5-VL,\ntitle = {Qwen2.5-VL},\nurl = {https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl/},\nauthor = {Qwen Team},\nmonth = {January},\nyear = {2025}\n}\n@article{Qwen2VL,\ntitle={Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model's Perception of the World at Any Resolution},\nauthor={Wang, Peng and Bai, Shuai and Tan, Sinan and Wang, Shijie and Fan, Zhihao and Bai, Jinze and Chen, Keqin and Liu, Xuejing and Wang, Jialin and Ge, Wenbin and Fan, Yang and Dang, Kai and Du, Mengfei and Ren, Xuancheng and Men, Rui and Liu, Dayiheng and Zhou, Chang and Zhou, Jingren and Lin, Junyang},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.12191},\nyear={2024}\n}\n@article{Qwen-VL,\ntitle={Qwen-VL: A Versatile Vision-Language Model for Understanding, Localization, Text Reading, and Beyond},\nauthor={Bai, Jinze and Bai, Shuai and Yang, Shusheng and Wang, Shijie and Tan, Sinan and Wang, Peng and Lin, Junyang and Zhou, Chang and Zhou, Jingren},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.12966},\nyear={2023}\n}",

The model belongs to the Phi-4 model family and supports 128K token context length. The model underwent an enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to support precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.\n📰 Phi-4-mini Microsoft Blog\n📖 Phi-4-mini Technical Report\n👩‍🍳 Phi Cookbook\n🏡 Phi Portal\n🖥️ Try It Azure, Huggingface\n🚀 Model paper\nIntended Uses\nPrimary Use Cases\nThe model is intended for broad multilingual commercial and research use. The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications which require:\nMemory/compute constrained environments\nLatency bound scenarios\nStrong reasoning (especially math and logic).\nThe model is designed to accelerate research on language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features.\nUse Case Considerations\nThe model is not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models, as well as performance difference across languages, as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios.\nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including but not limited to privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case.\nNothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.\nRelease Notes\nThis release of Phi-4-mini-instruct is based on valuable user feedback from the Phi-3 series. The Phi-4-mini model employed new architecture for efficiency, larger vocabulary for multilingual support, and better post-training techniques were used for instruction following, function calling, as well as additional data leading to substantial gains on key capabilities. It is anticipated that most use cases will benefit from this release, but users are encouraged to test in their particular AI applications. The enthusiastic support for the Phi-4 series is greatly appreciated. Feedback on Phi-4-mini-instruct is welcomed and crucial to the model’s evolution and improvement.\nModel Quality\nTo understand the capabilities, the 3.8B parameters Phi-4-mini-instruct  model was compared with a set of models over a variety of benchmarks using an internal benchmark platform (See Appendix A for benchmark methodology).

However, it is still fundamentally limited by its size for certain tasks. The model simply does not have the capacity to store too much factual knowledge, therefore, users may experience factual incorrectness. However, it may be possible to resolve such weakness by augmenting Phi-4 with a search engine, particularly when using the model under RAG settings.\nUsage\nTokenizer\nPhi-4-mini-instruct supports a vocabulary size of up to 200064 tokens. The tokenizer files already provide placeholder tokens that can be used for downstream fine-tuning, but they can also be extended up to the model's vocabulary size.\nInput Formats\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-4-mini-instruct\nmodel is best suited for prompts using specific formats.\nBelow are the two primary formats:\nChat format\nThis format is used for general conversation and instructions:\n<|system|>Insert System Message<|end|><|user|>Insert User Message<|end|><|assistant|>\nTool-enabled function-calling format\nThis format is used when the user wants the model to provide function calls based on the given tools. The user should provide the available tools in the system prompt, wrapped by <|tool|> and <|/tool|> tokens. The tools should be specified in JSON format, using a JSON dump structure. Example:\n<|system|>You are a helpful assistant with some tools.<|tool|>[{\"name\": \"get_weather_updates\", \"description\": \"Fetches weather updates for a given city using the RapidAPI Weather API.\", \"parameters\": {\"city\": {\"description\": \"The name of the city for which to retrieve weather information.\", \"type\": \"str\", \"default\": \"London\"}}}]<|/tool|><|end|><|user|>What is the weather like in Paris today?<|end|><|assistant|>\nInference with vLLM\nRequirements\nList of required packages:\nflash_attn==2.7.4.post1\ntorch==2.5.1\nvllm>=0.7.3\nExample\nTo perform inference using vLLM, you can use the following code snippet:\nfrom vllm import LLM, SamplingParams\nllm = LLM(model=\"microsoft/Phi-4-mini-instruct\", trust_remote_code=True)\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful AI assistant.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you provide ways to eat combinations of bananas and dragonfruits?\"},\n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Sure!

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include:\nQuality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text and some additional multilingual text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance as well as performance disparities across non-English. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English.\nMultilingual performance and safety gaps: We believe it is important to make language models more widely available across different languages, but the Phi 4 models still exhibit challenges common across multilingual releases. As with any deployment of LLMs, developers will be better positioned to test for performance or safety gaps for their linguistic and cultural context and customize the model with additional fine-tuning and appropriate safeguards.\nRepresentation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups, cultural contexts, or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases.\nInappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the case.\nInformation Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated.\nLimited Scope for Code: The majority of Phi 4 training data is based in Python and uses common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, it is  strongly recommended that users manually verify all API uses.\nLong Conversation: Phi 4 models, like other models, can in some cases generate responses that are repetitive, unhelpful, or inconsistent in very long chat sessions in both English and non-English languages. Developers are encouraged to place appropriate mitigations, like limiting conversation turns to account for the possible conversational drift.\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices, including mapping, measuring, and mitigating risks associated with their specific use case and cultural, linguistic context. Phi 4 family of models are general purpose models. As developers plan to deploy these models for specific use cases, they are encouraged to fine-tune the models for their use case and leverage the models as part of broader AI systems with language-specific safeguards in place. Important areas for consideration include:\nAllocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\nHigh-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess the suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\nMisinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nGeneration of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\nMisuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nTraining\nModel\nArchitecture: Phi-4-mini-instruct has 3.8B parameters and is a dense decoder-only Transformer model. When compared with Phi-3.5-mini, the major changes with Phi-4-mini-instruct are 200K vocabulary, grouped-query attention, and shared input and output embedding.\nInputs: Text. It is best suited for prompts using the chat format.\nContext length: 128K tokens\nGPUs: 512 A100-80G\nTraining time: 21 days\nTraining data: 5T tokens\nOutputs: Generated text in response to the input\nDates: Trained between November and December 2024\nStatus: This is a static model trained on offline datasets with the cutoff date of June 2024 for publicly available data.\nSupported languages: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian\nRelease date: February 2025\nTraining Datasets\nPhi-4-mini’s training data includes a wide variety of sources, totaling 5 trillion tokens, and is a combination of\npublicly available documents filtered for quality, selected high-quality educational data, and code\nnewly created synthetic, “textbook-like” data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (e.g., science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.)\nhigh quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness. Focus was placed on the quality of data that could potentially improve the reasoning ability for the model, and the publicly available documents were filtered to contain a preferred level of knowledge. As an example, the result of a game in premier league on a particular day might be good training data for frontier models, but such information was removed to leave more model capacity for reasoning for the model’s small size. More details about data can be found in the Phi-4-mini-instruct technical report.\nThe decontamination process involved normalizing and tokenizing the dataset, then generating and comparing n-grams between the target dataset and benchmark datasets. Samples with matching n-grams above a threshold were flagged as contaminated and removed from the dataset. A detailed contamination report was generated, summarizing the matched text, matching ratio, and filtered results for further analysis.\nFine-tuning\nA basic example of multi-GPUs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with TRL and Accelerate modules is provided here.\nSafety Evaluation and Red-Teaming\nVarious evaluation techniques including red teaming, adversarial conversation simulations, and multilingual safety evaluation benchmark datasets were leveraged to evaluate Phi-4 models’ propensity to produce undesirable outputs across multiple languages and risk categories. Several approaches were used to compensate for the limitations of one approach alone. Findings across the various evaluation methods indicate that safety post-training that was done as detailed in the Phi 3 Safety Post-Training paper had a positive impact across multiple languages and risk categories as observed by refusal rates (refusal to output undesirable outputs) and robustness to jailbreak techniques. Details on prior red team evaluations across Phi models can be found in the Phi 3 Safety Post-Training paper. For this release, the red team tested the model in English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Thai, and Russian for the following potential harms: Hate Speech and Bias, Violent Crimes, Specialized Advice, and Election Information. Their findings indicate that the model is resistant to jailbreak techniques across languages, but that language-specific attack prompts leveraging cultural context can cause the model to output harmful content. Another insight was that with function calling scenarios, the model could sometimes hallucinate function names or URL’s.  The model may also be more susceptible to longer multi-turn jailbreak techniques across both English and non-English languages. These findings highlight the need for industry-wide investment in the development of high-quality safety evaluation datasets across multiple languages, including low resource languages, and risk areas that account for cultural nuances where those languages are spoken.\nSoftware\nPyTorch\nTransformers\nFlash-Attention\nHardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-4-mini-instruct model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run. We have tested on the following GPU types:\nNVIDIA A100\nNVIDIA A6000\nNVIDIA H100\nIf you want to run the model on:\nNVIDIA V100 or earlier generation GPUs: call AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained() with attn_implementation=\"eager\"\nLicense\nThe model is licensed under the MIT license.\nTrademarks\nThis project may contain trademarks or logos for projects, products, or services.

Indeed, this is our default approach, and is the case in the vast majority of models we have run to date.\nThere are, however, some exceptions to this. In some cases, we see a model that performs worse than expected on a given eval due to a failure to respect the output format. For example:\nA model may refuse to answer questions (for no apparent reason), or in coding tasks models may prefix their response with “Sure, I can help with that. …” which may break the parser. In such cases, we have opted to try different system messages (e.g. “You must always respond to a question” or “Get to the point!”).\nWith some models, we observed that few shots actually hurt model performance. In this case we did allow running the benchmarks with 0-shots for all cases.\nWe have tools to convert between chat and completions APIs. When converting a chat prompt to a completion prompt, some models have different keywords e.g. Human vs User. In these cases, we do allow for model-specific mappings for chat to completion prompts.\nHowever, we do not:\nPick different few-shot examples. Few shots will always be the same when comparing different models.\nChange prompt format: e.g. if it is an A/B/C/D multiple choice, we do not tweak this to 1/2/3/4 multiple choice.\nBenchmark datasets\nThe model was evaluated across a breadth of public and internal benchmarks to understand the model’s capabilities under multiple tasks and conditions. While most evaluations use English, the leading multilingual benchmark was incorporated that covers performance in select languages.

This means the model will use its reasoning abilities to enhance the quality of generated responses. For example, when explicitly setting enable_thinking=True or leaving it as the default value in tokenizer.apply_chat_template, the model will engage its thinking mode.\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\nenable_thinking=True  # True is the default value for enable_thinking\n)\nIn this mode, the model will generate think content wrapped in a <think>...</think> block, followed by the final response.\nFor thinking mode, use Temperature=0.6, TopP=0.95, TopK=20, and MinP=0 (the default setting in generation_config.json). DO NOT use greedy decoding, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the Best Practices section.\nenable_thinking=False\nWe provide a hard switch to strictly disable the model's thinking behavior, aligning its functionality with the previous Qwen2.5-Instruct models. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where disabling thinking is essential for enhancing efficiency.\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\nenable_thinking=False  # Setting enable_thinking=False disables thinking mode\n)\nIn this mode, the model will not generate any think content and will not include a <think>...</think> block.\nFor non-thinking mode, we suggest using Temperature=0.7, TopP=0.8, TopK=20, and MinP=0. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the Best Practices section.\nAdvanced Usage: Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Modes via User Input\nWe provide a soft switch mechanism that allows users to dynamically control the model's behavior when enable_thinking=True. Specifically, you can add /think and /no_think to user prompts or system messages to switch the model's thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.\nHere is an example of a multi-turn conversation:\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nclass QwenChatbot:\ndef __init__(self, model_name=\"Qwen/Qwen3-4B\"):\nself.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nself.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\nself.history = []\ndef generate_response(self, user_input):\nmessages = self.history + [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}]\ntext = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True\n)\ninputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nresponse_ids = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=32768)[0][len(inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\nresponse = self.tokenizer.decode(response_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n# Update history\nself.history.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input})\nself.history.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response})\nreturn response\n# Example Usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\nchatbot = QwenChatbot()\n# First input (without /think or /no_think tags, thinking mode is enabled by default)\nuser_input_1 = \"How many r's in strawberries?\"\nprint(f\"User: {user_input_1}\")\nresponse_1 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_1)\nprint(f\"Bot: {response_1}\")\nprint(\"----------------------\")\n# Second input with /no_think\nuser_input_2 = \"Then, how many r's in blueberries? /no_think\"\nprint(f\"User: {user_input_2}\")\nresponse_2 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_2)\nprint(f\"Bot: {response_2}\")\nprint(\"----------------------\")\n# Third input with /think\nuser_input_3 = \"Really? /think\"\nprint(f\"User: {user_input_3}\")\nresponse_3 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_3)\nprint(f\"Bot: {response_3}\")\nFor API compatibility, when enable_thinking=True, regardless of whether the user uses /think or /no_think, the model will always output a block wrapped in <think>...</think>. However, the content inside this block may be empty if thinking is disabled.\nWhen enable_thinking=False, the soft switches are not valid.

For conversations where the total length (including both input and output) significantly exceeds this limit, we recommend using RoPE scaling techniques to handle long texts effectively. We have validated the model's performance on context lengths of up to 131,072 tokens using the YaRN method.\nYaRN is currently supported by several inference frameworks, e.g., transformers and llama.cpp for local use, vllm and sglang for deployment. In general, there are two approaches to enabling YaRN for supported frameworks:\nModifying the model files:\nIn the config.json file, add the rope_scaling fields:\n{\n...,\n\"rope_scaling\": {\n\"rope_type\": \"yarn\",\n\"factor\": 4.0,\n\"original_max_position_embeddings\": 32768\n}\n}\nFor llama.cpp, you need to regenerate the GGUF file after the modification.\nPassing command line arguments:\nFor vllm, you can use\nvllm serve ... --rope-scaling '{\"rope_type\":\"yarn\",\"factor\":4.0,\"original_max_position_embeddings\":32768}' --max-model-len 131072\nFor sglang, you can use\npython -m sglang.launch_server ... --json-model-override-args '{\"rope_scaling\":{\"rope_type\":\"yarn\",\"factor\":4.0,\"original_max_position_embeddings\":32768}}'\nFor llama-server from llama.cpp, you can use\nllama-server ... --rope-scaling yarn --rope-scale 4 --yarn-orig-ctx 32768\nIf you encounter the following warning\nUnrecognized keys in `rope_scaling` for 'rope_type'='yarn': {'original_max_position_embeddings'}\nplease upgrade transformers>=4.51.0.\nAll the notable open-source frameworks implement static YaRN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, potentially impacting performance on shorter texts.\nWe advise adding the rope_scaling configuration only when processing long contexts is required.\nIt is also recommended to modify the factor as needed. For example, if the typical context length for your application is 65,536 tokens, it would be better to set factor as 2.0.\nThe default max_position_embeddings in config.json is set to 40,960. This allocation includes reserving 32,768 tokens for outputs and 8,192 tokens for typical prompts, which is sufficient for most scenarios involving short text processing. If the average context length does not exceed 32,768 tokens, we do not recommend enabling YaRN in this scenario, as it may potentially degrade model performance.\nThe endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio supports dynamic YaRN by default and no extra configuration is needed.\nBest Practices\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\nSampling Parameters:\nFor thinking mode (enable_thinking=True), use Temperature=0.6, TopP=0.95, TopK=20, and MinP=0. DO NOT use greedy decoding, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions.\nFor non-thinking mode (enable_thinking=False), we suggest using Temperature=0.7, TopP=0.8, TopK=20, and MinP=0.\nFor supported frameworks, you can adjust the presence_penalty parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\nAdequate Output Length: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 38,912 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\nStandardize Output Format: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\nMath Problems: Include \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" in the prompt.\nMultiple-Choice Questions: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: \"Please show your choice in the answer field with only the choice letter, e.g., \"answer\": \"C\".\"\nNo Thinking Content in History: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\ntitle={Qwen3 Technical Report},\nauthor={Qwen Team},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2505.09388},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.CL},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388},\n}",

Built upon extensive training, Qwen3 delivers groundbreaking advancements in reasoning, instruction-following, agent capabilities, and multilingual support, with the following key features:\nUniquely support of seamless switching between thinking mode (for complex logical reasoning, math, and coding) and non-thinking mode (for efficient, general-purpose dialogue) within single model, ensuring optimal performance across various scenarios.\nSignificantly enhancement in its reasoning capabilities, surpassing previous QwQ (in thinking mode) and Qwen2.5 instruct models (in non-thinking mode) on mathematics, code generation, and commonsense logical reasoning.\nSuperior human preference alignment, excelling in creative writing, role-playing, multi-turn dialogues, and instruction following, to deliver a more natural, engaging, and immersive conversational experience.\nExpertise in agent capabilities, enabling precise integration with external tools in both thinking and unthinking modes and achieving leading performance among open-source models in complex agent-based tasks.\nSupport of 100+ languages and dialects with strong capabilities for multilingual instruction following and translation.\nModel Overview\nQwen3-30B-A3B has the following features:\nType: Causal Language Models\nTraining Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\nNumber of Parameters: 30.5B in total and 3.3B activated\nNumber of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 29.9B\nNumber of Layers: 48\nNumber of Attention Heads (GQA): 32 for Q and 4 for KV\nNumber of Experts: 128\nNumber of Activated Experts: 8\nContext Length: 32,768 natively and 131,072 tokens with YaRN.\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our blog, GitHub, and Documentation.\nQuickstart\nThe code of Qwen3-MoE has been in the latest Hugging Face transformers and we advise you to use the latest version of transformers.\nWith transformers<4.51.0, you will encounter the following error:\nKeyError: 'qwen3_moe'\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B\"\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_name,\ntorch_dtype=\"auto\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = \"Give me a short introduction to large language model.\"\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\nenable_thinking=True # Switches between thinking and non-thinking modes. Default is True.\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n**model_inputs,\nmax_new_tokens=32768\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\n# parsing thinking content\ntry:\n# rindex finding 151668 (</think>)\nindex = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)\nexcept ValueError:\nindex = 0\nthinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True).strip(\"\\n\")\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip(\"\\n\")\nprint(\"thinking content:\", thinking_content)\nprint(\"content:\", content)\nFor deployment, you can use sglang>=0.4.6.post1 or vllm>=0.8.5 or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:\nSGLang:python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B --reasoning-parser qwen3\nvLLM:vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1\nFor local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.\nSwitching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Mode\nThe enable_thinking switch is also available in APIs created by SGLang and vLLM.\nPlease refer to our documentation for SGLang and vLLM users.\nenable_thinking=True\nBy default, Qwen3 has thinking capabilities enabled, similar to QwQ-32B. This means the model will use its reasoning abilities to enhance the quality of generated responses. For example, when explicitly setting enable_thinking=True or leaving it as the default value in tokenizer.apply_chat_template, the model will engage its thinking mode.\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\nenable_thinking=True  # True is the default value for enable_thinking\n)\nIn this mode, the model will generate think content wrapped in a <think>...</think> block, followed by the final response.\nFor thinking mode, use Temperature=0.6, TopP=0.95, TopK=20, and MinP=0 (the default setting in generation_config.json). DO NOT use greedy decoding, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the Best Practices section.\nenable_thinking=False\nWe provide a hard switch to strictly disable the model's thinking behavior, aligning its functionality with the previous Qwen2.5-Instruct models. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where disabling thinking is essential for enhancing efficiency.\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\nenable_thinking=False  # Setting enable_thinking=False disables thinking mode\n)\nIn this mode, the model will not generate any think content and will not include a <think>...</think> block.\nFor non-thinking mode, we suggest using Temperature=0.7, TopP=0.8, TopK=20, and MinP=0. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the Best Practices section.\nAdvanced Usage: Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Modes via User Input\nWe provide a soft switch mechanism that allows users to dynamically control the model's behavior when enable_thinking=True. Specifically, you can add /think and /no_think to user prompts or system messages to switch the model's thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.\nHere is an example of a multi-turn conversation:\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nclass QwenChatbot:\ndef __init__(self, model_name=\"Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B\"):\nself.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nself.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\nself.history = []\ndef generate_response(self, user_input):\nmessages = self.history + [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}]\ntext = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\ntokenize=False,\nadd_generation_prompt=True\n)\ninputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nresponse_ids = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=32768)[0][len(inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\nresponse = self.tokenizer.decode(response_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n# Update history\nself.history.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input})\nself.history.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response})\nreturn response\n# Example Usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\nchatbot = QwenChatbot()\n# First input (without /think or /no_think tags, thinking mode is enabled by default)\nuser_input_1 = \"How many r's in strawberries?\"\nprint(f\"User: {user_input_1}\")\nresponse_1 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_1)\nprint(f\"Bot: {response_1}\")\nprint(\"----------------------\")\n# Second input with /no_think\nuser_input_2 = \"Then, how many r's in blueberries? /no_think\"\nprint(f\"User: {user_input_2}\")\nresponse_2 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_2)\nprint(f\"Bot: {response_2}\")\nprint(\"----------------------\")\n# Third input with /think\nuser_input_3 = \"Really? /think\"\nprint(f\"User: {user_input_3}\")\nresponse_3 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_3)\nprint(f\"Bot: {response_3}\")\nFor API compatibility, when enable_thinking=True, regardless of whether the user uses /think or /no_think, the model will always output a block wrapped in <think>...</think>. However, the content inside this block may be empty if thinking is disabled.\nWhen enable_thinking=False, the soft switches are not valid. Regardless of any /think or /no_think tags input by the user, the model will not generate think content and will not include a <think>...</think> block.\nAgentic Use\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities.

This upgrade is driven by a series of key technical innovations, mainly including the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, upgraded training data, and high-compression video generation.\n(1) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture\nWan2.2 introduces Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture into the video generation diffusion model. MoE has been widely validated in large language models as an efficient approach to increase total model parameters while keeping inference cost nearly unchanged. In Wan2.2, the A14B model series adopts a two-expert design tailored to the denoising process of diffusion models: a high-noise expert for the early stages, focusing on overall layout; and a low-noise expert for the later stages, refining video details. Each expert model has about 14B parameters, resulting in a total of 27B parameters but only 14B active parameters per step, keeping inference computation and GPU memory nearly unchanged.\nThe transition point between the two experts is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a metric that decreases monotonically as the denoising step $t$ increases. At the beginning of the denoising process, $t$ is large and the noise level is high, so the SNR is at its minimum, denoted as ${SNR}{min}$. In this stage, the high-noise expert is activated. We define a threshold step ${t}{moe}$ corresponding to half of the ${SNR}{min}$, and switch to the low-noise expert when $t<{t}{moe}$.\nTo validate the effectiveness of the MoE architecture, four settings are compared based on their validation loss curves. The baseline Wan2.1 model does not employ the MoE architecture. Among the MoE-based variants, the Wan2.1 & High-Noise Expert reuses the Wan2.1 model as the low-noise expert while uses the  Wan2.2's high-noise expert, while the Wan2.1 & Low-Noise Expert uses Wan2.1 as the high-noise expert and employ the Wan2.2's low-noise expert. The Wan2.2 (MoE) (our final version) achieves the lowest validation loss, indicating that its generated video distribution is closest to ground-truth and exhibits superior convergence.\n(2) Efficient High-Definition Hybrid TI2V\nTo enable more efficient deployment, Wan2.2 also explores a high-compression design. In addition to the 27B MoE models, a 5B dense model, i.e., TI2V-5B, is released. It is supported by a high-compression Wan2.2-VAE, which achieves a $T\\times H\\times W$ compression ratio of $4\\times16\\times16$, increasing the overall compression rate to 64 while maintaining high-quality video reconstruction. With an additional patchification layer, the total compression ratio of TI2V-5B reaches $4\\times32\\times32$. Without specific optimization, TI2V-5B can generate a 5-second 720P video in under 9 minutes on a single consumer-grade GPU, ranking among the fastest 720P@24fps video generation models. This model also natively supports both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks within a single unified framework, covering both academic research and practical applications.\nComparisons to SOTAs\nWe compared Wan2.2 with leading closed-source commercial models on our new Wan-Bench 2.0, evaluating performance across multiple crucial dimensions. The results demonstrate that Wan2.2 achieves superior performance compared to these leading models.\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, please cite us.\n@article{wan2025,\ntitle={Wan: Open and Advanced Large-Scale Video Generative Models},\nauthor={Team Wan and Ang Wang and Baole Ai and Bin Wen and Chaojie Mao and Chen-Wei Xie and Di Chen and Feiwu Yu and Haiming Zhao and Jianxiao Yang and Jianyuan Zeng and Jiayu Wang and Jingfeng Zhang and Jingren Zhou and Jinkai Wang and Jixuan Chen and Kai Zhu and Kang Zhao and Keyu Yan and Lianghua Huang and Mengyang Feng and Ningyi Zhang and Pandeng Li and Pingyu Wu and Ruihang Chu and Ruili Feng and Shiwei Zhang and Siyang Sun and Tao Fang and Tianxing Wang and Tianyi Gui and Tingyu Weng and Tong Shen and Wei Lin and Wei Wang and Wei Wang and Wenmeng Zhou and Wente Wang and Wenting Shen and Wenyuan Yu and Xianzhong Shi and Xiaoming Huang and Xin Xu and Yan Kou and Yangyu Lv and Yifei Li and Yijing Liu and Yiming Wang and Yingya Zhang and Yitong Huang and Yong Li and You Wu and Yu Liu and Yulin Pan and Yun Zheng and Yuntao Hong and Yupeng Shi and Yutong Feng and Zeyinzi Jiang and Zhen Han and Zhi-Fan Wu and Ziyu Liu},\njournal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.20314},\nyear={2025}\n}\nLicense Agreement\nThe models in this repository are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

We recommend you install it after you've installed latest PyTorch version.\npip install -U nemo_toolkit['asr']\nThe model is available for use in the NeMo toolkit [6], and can be used as a pre-trained checkpoint for inference or for fine-tuning on another dataset.\nAutomatically instantiate the model\nfrom nemo.collections.asr.models import ASRModel\nasr_ast_model = ASRModel.from_pretrained(model_name=\"nvidia/canary-1b-v2\")\nTranscribing using Python\nFirst, let's get a sample:\nwget https://dldata-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2086-149220-0033.wav\nThen simply do:\noutput = asr_ast_model.transcribe(['2086-149220-0033.wav'], source_lang='en', target_lang='en')\nprint(output[0].text)\nTranslating using Python\nBe sure to specify necessary target_lang for proper translation:\noutput = asr_ast_model.transcribe(['2086-149220-0033.wav'], source_lang='en', target_lang='fr')\nprint(output[0].text)\nTranscribing with timestamps\nNote: Use main branch of NeMo to get timestamps until it is released in NeMo 2.5.\nTo transcribe with timestamps:\noutput = asr_model.transcribe(['2086-149220-0033.wav'], source_lang='en', target_lang='en', timestamps=True)\n# by default, timestamps are enabled for word and segment level\nword_timestamps = output[0].timestamp['word'] # word level timestamps for first sample\nsegment_timestamps = output[0].timestamp['segment'] # segment level timestamps\nfor stamp in segment_timestamps:\nprint(f\"{stamp['start']}s - {stamp['end']}s : {stamp['segment']}\")\nTranslating with timestamps\nTo translate with timestamps:\noutput = asr_model.transcribe(['2086-149220-0033.wav'], source_lang='en', target_lang='fr', timestamps=True)\nsegment_timestamps = output[0].timestamp['segment'] # only supports segment level timestamps for translation\nfor stamp in segment_timestamps:\nprint(f\"{stamp['start']}s - {stamp['end']}s : {stamp['segment']}\")\nFor translation task, please, refer to segment-level timestamps for getting intuitive and accurate alignment.\nNote: If timestamps are not required for your work, you can reduce memory usage by restoring only the .nemo file without the auxiliary CTC model. To do this, extract the .nemo file, remove any timestamps_asr_model files, then repackage it into a new .nemo file.\nSoftware Integration\nRuntime Engine(s):\nNeMo main branch (until it is released in NeMo 2.5)\nSupported Hardware Microarchitecture Compatibility:\nNVIDIA Ampere\nNVIDIA Blackwell\nNVIDIA Hopper\n[Preferred/Supported] Operating System(s):\nLinux\nHardware Specific Requirements:\nAt least 6GB RAM for model to load.\nModel Version\nCurrent version: Canary-1b-v2.

As real-world AI tasks grow increasingly complex, VLMs urgently need to enhance reasoning capabilities beyond basic multimodal perception — improving accuracy, comprehensiveness, and intelligence — to enable complex problem solving, long-context understanding, and multimodal agents.\nThrough our open-source work, we aim to explore the technological frontier together with the community while empowering more developers to create exciting and innovative applications.\nThis Hugging Face repository hosts the GLM-4.5V model, part of the GLM-V series.\nGLM-4.5V\nGLM-4.5V is based on ZhipuAI’s next-generation flagship text foundation model GLM-4.5-Air (106B parameters, 12B active). It continues the technical approach of GLM-4.1V-Thinking, achieving SOTA performance among models of the same scale on 42 public vision-language benchmarks. It covers common tasks such as image, video, and document understanding, as well as GUI agent operations.\nBeyond benchmark performance, GLM-4.5V focuses on real-world usability. Through efficient hybrid training, it can handle diverse types of visual content, enabling full-spectrum vision reasoning, including:\nImage reasoning (scene understanding, complex multi-image analysis, spatial recognition)\nVideo understanding (long video segmentation and event recognition)\nGUI tasks (screen reading, icon recognition, desktop operation assistance)\nComplex chart & long document parsing (research report analysis, information extraction)\nGrounding (precise visual element localization)\nThe model also introduces a Thinking Mode switch, allowing users to balance between quick responses and deep reasoning. This switch works the same as in the GLM-4.5 language model.\nGLM-4.1V-9B\nContextual information about GLM-4.1V-9B is provided for completeness, as it is part of the GLM-V series and foundational to GLM-4.5V's development.\nBuilt on the GLM-4-9B-0414 foundation model, the GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking model introduces a reasoning paradigm and uses RLCS (Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling) to comprehensively enhance model capabilities. It achieves the strongest performance among 10B-level VLMs and matches or surpasses the much larger Qwen-2.5-VL-72B in 18 benchmark tasks.\nWe also open-sourced the base model GLM-4.1V-9B-Base to support researchers in exploring the limits of vision-language model capabilities.\nCompared with the previous generation CogVLM2 and GLM-4V series, GLM-4.1V-Thinking brings:\nThe series’ first reasoning-focused model, excelling in multiple domains beyond mathematics.\n64k context length support.\nSupport for any aspect ratio and up to 4k image resolution.\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) open-source version.\nGLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking integrates the Chain-of-Thought reasoning mechanism, improving accuracy, richness, and interpretability. It leads on 23 out of 28 benchmark tasks at the 10B parameter scale, and outperforms Qwen-2.5-VL-72B on 18 tasks despite its smaller size.\nProject Updates\n🔥 News: 2025/08/11: We released GLM-4.5V with significant improvements across multiple benchmarks. We also open-sourced our handcrafted desktop assistant app for debugging. Once connected to GLM-4.5V, it can capture visual information from your PC screen via screenshots or screen recordings. Feel free to try it out or customize it into your own multimodal assistant.

The bounding box is given as four numbers — for example [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) is the top-left corner and (x2, y2)` is the bottom-right corner. The bracket style may vary ([], [[]], (), <>, etc.), but the meaning is the same: it encloses the coordinates of the box. These coordinates are relative values between 0 and 1000, normalized to the image size.\nFor more code information, please visit our GitHub.\nGrounding Example\nGLM-4.5V equips precise grounding capabilities. Given a prompt that requests the location of a specific object, GLM-4.5V is able to reasoning step-by-step and identify the bounding boxes of the target object. The query prompt supports complex descriptions of the target object as well as specified output formats, for example:\nHelp me to locate  in the image and give me its bounding boxes.\nPlease pinpoint the bounding box [[x1,y1,x2,y2], …] in the image as per the given description.\nHere, <expr> is the description of the target object. The output bounding box is a quadruple $$[x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2]$$ composed of the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners, where each value is normalized by the image width (for x) or height (for y) and scaled by 1000.\nIn the response, the special tokens <|begin_of_box|> and <|end_of_box|> are used to mark the image bounding box in the answer. The bracket style may vary ([], [[]], (), <>, etc.), but the meaning is the same: to enclose the coordinates of the box.\nGUI Agent Example\nexamples/gui-agent: Demonstrates prompt construction and output handling for GUI Agents, including strategies for mobile, PC, and web. Prompt templates differ between GLM-4.1V and GLM-4.5V.\nQuick Demo Application\nexamples/vlm-helper: A desktop assistant for GLM multimodal models (mainly GLM-4.5V, compatible with GLM-4.1V), supporting text, images, videos, PDFs, PPTs, and more.

Below is an example of dataset construction using two images. You should organize your dataset into finetune.json in the following format, This is an example for fine-tuning GLM-4.1V-9B.\n[\n{\n\"messages\": [\n{\n\"content\": \"<image>Who are they?\",\n\"role\": \"user\"\n},\n{\n\"content\": \"<think>\nUser asked me to observe the image and find the answer. I know they are Kane and Goretzka from Bayern Munich.</think>\n<answer>They're Kane and Goretzka from Bayern Munich.</answer>\",\n\"role\": \"assistant\"\n},\n{\n\"content\": \"<image>What are they doing?\",\n\"role\": \"user\"\n},\n{\n\"content\": \"<think>\nI need to observe what these people are doing.

In GLM-4.5V, common issues such as repetitive thinking and incorrect output formatting are alleviated. However, some limitations remain:\nIn frontend code reproduction cases, the model may output raw HTML without proper markdown wrapping. There may also be character escaping issues, potentially causing rendering errors. We provide a patch to fix most cases.\nPure text Q&A capabilities still have room for improvement, as this release focused primarily on multimodal scenarios.\nIn some cases, the model may overthink or repeat content, especially for complex prompts.\nOccasionally, the model may restate the answer at the end.\nThere are some perception issues, with room for improvement in tasks such as counting and identifying specific individuals.\nWe welcome feedback in the issue section and will address problems as quickly as possible.\nCitation\nIf you use this model, please cite the following paper:\n@misc{vteam2025glm45vglm41vthinkingversatilemultimodal,\ntitle={GLM-4.5V and GLM-4.1V-Thinking: Towards Versatile Multimodal Reasoning with Scalable Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={V Team and Wenyi Hong and Wenmeng Yu and Xiaotao Gu and Guo Wang and Guobing Gan and Haomiao Tang and Jiale Cheng and Ji Qi and Junhui Ji and Lihang Pan and Shuaiqi Duan and Weihan Wang and Yan Wang and Yean Cheng and Zehai He and Zhe Su and Zhen Yang and Ziyang Pan and Aohan Zeng and Baoxu Wang and Bin Chen and Boyan Shi and Changyu Pang and Chenhui Zhang and Da Yin and Fan Yang and Guoqing Chen and Jiazheng Xu and Jiale Zhu and Jiali Chen and Jing Chen and Jinhao Chen and Jinghao Lin and Jinjiang Wang and Junjie Chen and Leqi Lei and Letian Gong and Leyi Pan and Mingdao Liu and Mingde Xu and Mingzhi Zhang and Qinkai Zheng and Sheng Yang and Shi Zhong and Shiyu Huang and Shuyuan Zhao and Siyan Xue and Shangqin Tu and Shengbiao Meng and Tianshu Zhang and Tianwei Luo and Tianxiang Hao and Tianyu Tong and Wenkai Li and Wei Jia and Xiao Liu and Xiaohan Zhang and Xin Lyu and Xinyue Fan and Xuancheng Huang and Yanling Wang and Yadong Xue and Yanfeng Wang and Yanzi Wang and Yifan An and Yifan Du and Yiming Shi and Yiheng Huang and Yilin Niu and Yuan Wang and Yuanchang Yue and Yuchen Li and Yutao Zhang and Yuting Wang and Yu Wang and Yuxuan Zhang and Zhao Xue and Zhenyu Hou and Zhengxiao Du and Zihan Wang and Peng Zhang and Debing Liu and Bin Xu and Juanzi Li and Minlie Huang and Yuxiao Dong and Jie Tang},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2507.01006},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.CV},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01006},\n}",

    "meituan-longcat/LongCat-Flash-Chat": "LongCat-Flash-Chat\nModel Introduction\nKey Features\nEvaluation Results\nQuick Start\nChat Template\nDeployment\nChat Website\nLicense Agreement\nUsage Considerations\nCitation\nContact\nLongCat-Flash-Chat\nModel Introduction\nWe introduce LongCat-Flash, a powerful and efficient language model with 560 billion total parameters, featuring an innovative Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The model incorporates a dynamic computation mechanism that activates 18.6B∼31.3B parameters (averaging∼27B) based on contextual demands, optimizing both computational efficiency and performance. To achieve advanced training and inference efficiency, we employ a shortcut-connected architecture that expands computation-communication overlap window, achieving over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference cost-effectively. Our comprehensive training and scaling strategies ensure stable, efficient training, while tailored data strategies enhance model performance.\nNow we release LongCat-Flash-Chat, a non-thinking foundation model that delivers highly competitive performance among leading models, with exceptional strengths in agentic tasks.\nKey Features\n🌟 Scalable Architectural Design for Computational Efficiency\nLongCat-Flash is designed and optimized under two key principles: efficient computation utilization, as well as  efficient training and inference. Specifically, (1) As not all tokens are equal, we introduce the zero-computation experts mechanism in MoE blocks to allocate a dynamic computation budget to important tokens based on their significance, i.e., activating 18.6 to 31.3 billion parameters (out of 560 billion total) based on contextual demands. To ensure consistent computation load, we employ expert bias adjusted by a PID-controller, maintaining an average of∼27 billion activated parameters per token. (2) As communication overhead becomes a bottleneck during MoE model scaling, we incorporate the Shortcut-connected MoE (ScMoE) design to expand the computation-communication overlap window. Combined with customized infrastructure optimizations, this design enables training at a massive scale of over tens of thousands accelerators and inference with high throughput and low latency.\n🌟 Effective Model Scaling Strategy\nEffectively and efficiently scaling model size remains a key challenge in strategy design. To this end, we develop a comprehensive stability-and-scaling framework for robustly training large-scale models: (1) We successfully apply a hyperparameter transfer strategy to such a large model, predicting optimal hyperparameter configurations by leveraging results from smaller proxy models with theoretical guarantees. (2) We initialize the model using a model-growth mechanism based on a refined half-scale checkpoint, achieving improved performance compared to conventional initialization methods. (3) A multi-pronged stability suite incorporates principled router-gradient balancing, a hidden z-loss to suppress massive activations, and fine-tuned optimizer configurations. (4) To enhance the reliability of large-scale cluster training, we introduce deterministic computation. This guarantees the exact reproducibility of experiments and enables the detection of SDC (Silent Data Corruption) during the training process. These interventions ensure that LongCat-Flash ’s training remains stable, with no irrecoverable loss spikes.\n🌟 Multi-Stage Training Pipeline for Agentic Capability\nThrough a meticulously designed pipeline, LongCat-Flash is endowed with advanced agentic behaviors. Initial efforts focus on constructing a more suitable base model for agentic post-training, where we design a two-stage pretraining data fusion strategy to concentrate reasoning-intensive domain data. During mid-training, we enhance reasoning and coding capabilities while extending the context length to 128k to meet agentic post-training requirements. Building on this advanced base model, we proceed with a multi-stage post-training. Recognizing the scarcity of high-quality, high-difficulty training problems for agentic tasks, we design a multi-agent synthesis framework that defines task difficulty across three axes, i.e., information processing, tool-set complexity, and user interaction—using specialized controllers to generate complex tasks requiring iterative reasoning and environmental interaction.\nFor more detail, please refer to the comprehensive LongCat-Flash Technical Report.\nEvaluation Results\nBenchmark\nDeepSeek V3.1\nQwen3 MoE-2507\nKimi-K2\nGPT-4.1\nClaude4 Sonnet\nGemini2.5 Flash\nLongCat-Flash\nArchitecture\nMoE\nMoE\nMoE\n-\n-\n-\nMoE\n# Total Params\n671B\n235B\n1043B\n-\n-\n-\n560B\n# Activated Params\n37B\n22B\n32B\n-\n-\n-\n27B\nGeneral Domains\nMMLU(acc)\n90.96\n90.23\n89.86\n89.64\n91.75\n86.33\n89.71\nMMLU-Pro(acc)\n84.45\n84.83\n82.06\n81.72\n83.74\n81.95\n82.68\nArenaHard-V2(acc)\n84.10\n88.20\n85.70\n61.50\n62.10\n77.00\n86.50\nCEval(acc)\n89.21\n92.70\n91.26\n79.53\n86.63\n78.78\n90.44\nCMMLU(acc)\n88.04\n88.14\n89.66\n77.65\n86.51\n78.30\n84.34\nInstruction Following\nIFEval(acc)\n86.69\n88.54\n88.91\n85.58\n88.35\n83.92\n89.65\nCOLLIE(acc)\n43.80\n49.71\n56.34\n50.00\n51.22\n48.60\n57.10\nMeeseeks-zh(acc)\n33.83\n35.32\n42.79\n41.54\n35.07\n34.84\n43.03\nMathematical Reasoning\nMATH500(acc)\n96.08\n98.80\n97.60\n90.60\n93.80\n98.40\n96.40\nAIME24(avg@10)\n66.30*\n81.67\n69.60*\n47.00\n47.00\n79.67\n70.42\nAIME25(avg@10)\n49.27\n68.33\n50.66\n32.00\n37.00\n67.33\n61.25\nBeyondAIME(avg@10)\n36.50\n57.60\n36.60\n22.10\n20.50\n44.20\n43.00\nGeneral Reasoning\nGPQA-diamond(acc)\n74.90*\n77.43\n75.76\n67.68\n70.71\n80.30\n73.23\nDROP(f1)\n84.19\n78.57\n89.04\n66.94\n73.06\n45.03\n79.06\nZebraLogic(acc)\n85.30\n94.22\n89.11\n56.30*\n75.85\n51.78\n89.30\nGraphWalks-128k(precision)\n73.54\n80.72\n47.50\n85.02\n80.57\n64.83\n51.05\nCoding\nLiveCodeBench(pass@1)\n56.40*\n46.48\n46.70\n39.21\n45.59\n39.65\n48.02\nHumaneval+(pass@1)\n92.68\n94.51\n85.98\n93.29\n94.51\n87.80\n88.41\nMBPP+(pass@1)\n79.89\n79.89\n81.75\n79.37\n80.16\n76.19\n79.63\nSWE-Bench-Verified(acc)\n66.00*\n42.00\n64.60\n48.60\n68.00*\n40.60\n60.40\nTerminalBench(acc)\n31.30*\n17.28\n25.93\n28.40\n40.74\n12.35\n39.51\nAgentic Tool Use\nτ²-Bench (telecom)(avg@4)\n38.50\n22.50\n67.50\n35.20\n46.20\n16.50\n73.68\nτ²-Bench (airline)(avg@4)\n46.00\n36.00\n54.20\n56.00\n60.00\n41.50\n58.00\nτ²-Bench (retail)(avg@4)\n64.90\n70.50\n70.80\n74.10\n80.00\n64.80\n71.27\nAceBench(acc)\n69.70\n71.10\n82.20\n80.10*\n76.20*\n74.50*\n76.10\nVitaBench(avg@4)\n20.30\n8.50\n18.20\n19.00\n23.00\n8.00\n24.30\nSafety\nHarmful\n82.79\n80.82\n53.91\n56.19\n66.56\n-\n83.98\nCriminal\n87.83\n89.13\n77.19\n81.58\n87.58\n-\n91.24\nMisinformation\n83.17\n77.76\n42.68\n45.49\n54.91\n-\n81.72\nPrivacy\n98.80\n98.80\n96.39\n98.80\n100.00\n-\n93.98\nNote:\nValues marked with * are sourced from other public reports.\nDeepSeek-V3.1, Qwen3-235B-A22B, Gemini2.5-Flash, and Claude4-Sonnet are evaluated under their non-thinking mode.\nQuick Start\nChat Template\nThe details of our chat template are provided in the tokenizer_config.json file.

To save on inference cost when this is the case, you can disable reasoning:\n# Without reasoning for simple questions\nresult = moondream.query(\nimage=image,\nquestion=\"What color is the sky?\",\nreasoning=False\n)\nprint(result[\"answer\"])\nIf you want to stream outputs, pass in stream=True.

For the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality, real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics.
