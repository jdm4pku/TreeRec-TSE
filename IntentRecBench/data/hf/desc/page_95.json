We limit the number of visual tokens to 1024 to obtain a good training efficiency.\nDue to the lack of relevant data, our models and evaluations retain one single image.\nEnglish-only Training: Our models are trained on english data only. Although the Qwen2-VL models are multilingual, the multilingual-multimodal embedding performance are not guaranteed.\nWe will extend to multi-image input, image-text interleaved data as well as multilingual data in the future version.\nRedistribution and Use\nWe encourage and value diverse applications of GME models and continuous enhancements to the models themselves.\nIf you distribute or make GME models (or any derivative works) available, or if you create a product or service (including another AI model) that incorporates them, you must prominently display Built with GME on your website, user interface, blog post, About page, or product documentation.\nIf you utilize GME models or their outputs to develop, train, fine-tune, or improve an AI model that is distributed or made available, you must prefix the name of any such AI model with GME.\nCloud API Services\nIn addition to the open-source GME series models, GME series models are also available as commercial API services on Alibaba Cloud.\nMultiModal Embedding Models: The multimodal-embedding-v1 model service is available.\nNote that the models behind the commercial APIs are not entirely identical to the open-source models.\nHiring\nWe have open positions for Research Interns and Full-Time Researchers to join our team at Tongyi Lab.\nWe are seeking passionate individuals with expertise in representation learning, LLM-driven information retrieval, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and agent-based systems.\nOur team is located in the vibrant cities of Beijing and Hangzhou, offering a collaborative and dynamic work environment where you can contribute to cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nIf you are driven by curiosity and eager to make a meaningful impact through your work, we would love to hear from you.

Want Trained Voicepacks? See https://hf.co/posts/hexgrad/418806998707773\nKokoro is a frontier TTS model for its size of 82 million parameters (text in/audio out).\nOn 25 Dec 2024, Kokoro v0.19 weights were permissively released in full fp32 precision under an Apache 2.0 license. As of 2 Jan 2025, 10 unique Voicepacks have been released, and a .onnx version of v0.19 is available.\nIn the weeks leading up to its release, Kokoro v0.19 was the #1🥇 ranked model in TTS Spaces Arena. Kokoro had achieved higher Elo in this single-voice Arena setting over other models, using fewer parameters and less data:\nKokoro v0.19: 82M params, Apache, trained on <100 hours of audio\nXTTS v2: 467M, CPML, >10k hours\nEdge TTS: Microsoft, proprietary\nMetaVoice: 1.2B, Apache, 100k hours\nParler Mini: 880M, Apache, 45k hours\nFish Speech: ~500M, CC-BY-NC-SA, 1M hours\nKokoro's ability to top this Elo ladder suggests that the scaling law (Elo vs compute/data/params) for traditional TTS models might have a steeper slope than previously expected.\nYou can find a hosted demo at hf.co/spaces/hexgrad/Kokoro-TTS.\nUsage\nThe following can be run in a single cell on Google Colab.\n# 1️⃣ Install dependencies silently\n!git lfs install\n!git clone https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M\n%cd Kokoro-82M\n!apt-get -qq -y install espeak-ng > /dev/null 2>&1\n!pip install -q phonemizer torch transformers scipy munch\n# 2️⃣ Build the model and load the default voicepack\nfrom models import build_model\nimport torch\ndevice = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'\nMODEL = build_model('kokoro-v0_19.pth', device)\nVOICE_NAME = [\n'af', # Default voice is a 50-50 mix of Bella & Sarah\n'af_bella', 'af_sarah', 'am_adam', 'am_michael',\n'bf_emma', 'bf_isabella', 'bm_george', 'bm_lewis',\n'af_nicole', 'af_sky',\n][0]\nVOICEPACK = torch.load(f'voices/{VOICE_NAME}.pt', weights_only=True).to(device)\nprint(f'Loaded voice: {VOICE_NAME}')\n# 3️⃣ Call generate, which returns 24khz audio and the phonemes used\nfrom kokoro import generate\ntext = \"How could I know?

Note that this card applies only to this model, Kokoro. Original models published by the paper author can be found at hf.co/yl4579.\nEvaluation\nMetric: Elo rating\nLeaderboard: hf.co/spaces/Pendrokar/TTS-Spaces-Arena\nThe voice ranked in the Arena is a 50-50 mix of Bella and Sarah. For your convenience, this mix is included in this repository as af.pt, but you can trivially reproduce it like this:\nimport torch\nbella = torch.load('voices/af_bella.pt', weights_only=True)\nsarah = torch.load('voices/af_sarah.pt', weights_only=True)\naf = torch.mean(torch.stack([bella, sarah]), dim=0)\nassert torch.equal(af, torch.load('voices/af.pt', weights_only=True))\nTraining Details\nCompute: Kokoro was trained on A100 80GB vRAM instances rented from Vast.ai (referral link). Vast was chosen over other compute providers due to its competitive on-demand hourly rates. The average hourly cost for the A100 80GB vRAM instances used for training was below $1/hr per GPU, which was around half the quoted rates from other providers at the time.\nData: Kokoro was trained exclusively on permissive/non-copyrighted audio data and IPA phoneme labels. Examples of permissive/non-copyrighted audio include:\nPublic domain audio\nAudio licensed under Apache, MIT, etc\nSynthetic audio[1] generated by closed[2] TTS models from large providers\n[1] https://copyright.gov/ai/ai_policy_guidance.pdf\n[2] No synthetic audio from open TTS models or \"custom voice clones\"\nEpochs: Less than 20 epochs\nTotal Dataset Size: Less than 100 hours of audio\nLimitations\nKokoro v0.19 is limited in some specific ways, due to its training set and/or architecture:\n[Data] Lacks voice cloning capability, likely due to small <100h training set\n[Arch] Relies on external g2p (espeak-ng), which introduces a class of g2p failure modes\n[Data] Training dataset is mostly long-form reading and narration, not conversation\n[Arch] At 82M params, Kokoro almost certainly falls to a well-trained 1B+ param diffusion transformer, or a many-billion-param MLLM like GPT-4o / Gemini 2.0 Flash\n[Data] Multilingual capability is architecturally feasible, but training data is mostly English\nRefer to the Philosophy discussion to better understand these limitations.\nWill the other voicepacks be released? There is currently no release date scheduled for the other voicepacks, but in the meantime you can try them in the hosted demo at hf.co/spaces/hexgrad/Kokoro-TTS.\nAcknowledgements\n@yl4579 for architecting StyleTTS 2\n@Pendrokar for adding Kokoro as a contender in the TTS Spaces Arena\nModel Card Contact\n@rzvzn on Discord.
