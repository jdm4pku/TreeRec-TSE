Our 3D patch embeddings consist of a 3D convolutional layer, dividing the 3D input into non-overlapping cubes of size (t, h, w) for time, height, and width dimensions, respectively. For the 3D positional encodings, we first generate 1D sin/cos encodings individually for each dimension and then combine them together into a single, 3D positional encoding.\nSecond, we considered geolocation (center latitude and longitude) and date of acquisition (year and day-of-year ranging 1-365) in the pretraining of the TL model versions. Both encoder and decoder receive time and location information for each sample and encodes them independently using 2D sin/cos encoding. They are added to the embedded tokens via a weighted sum with learned weights: one for time and one for location and separate weights for encoder and decoder. Since this metadata is often not available, we added a drop mechanism during pretraining that randomly drops the geolocation and/or the temporal data to help the model learn how to handle the absence of this information.\nPre-trained Models\nModel\nDetails\nWeights\nPrithvi-EO-2.0-tiny-TL\nPretrained 5M parameter model with temporal and location embeddings\nhttps://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa-geospatial/Prithvi-EO-2.0-tiny-TL\nPrithvi-EO-2.0-100M-TL\nPretrained 100M parameter model with temporal and location embeddings\nhttps://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa-geospatial/Prithvi-EO-2.0-100M-TL\nPrithvi-EO-2.0-300M\nPretrained 300M parameter model\nhttps://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa-geospatial/Prithvi-EO-2.0-300M\nPrithvi-EO-2.0-300M-TL\nPretrained 300M parameter model with temporal and location embeddings\nhttps://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa-geospatial/Prithvi-EO-2.0-300M-TL\nPrithvi-EO-2.0-600M\nPretrained 600M parameter model\nhttps://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa-geospatial/Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M\nPrithvi-EO-2.0-600M-TL\nPretrained 600M parameter model with temporal and location embeddings\nhttps://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa-geospatial/Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M-TL\nThe models were pre-trained at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre with NASA's HLS V2 product (30m granularity) using 4.2M samples with six bands in the following order: Blue, Green, Red, Narrow NIR, SWIR, SWIR 2.\nBenchmarking\nWe validated the Prithvi-EO-2.0 models through extensive experiments using GEO-bench. Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M-TL outperforms the previous Prithvi-EO model by 8% across a range of tasks. It also outperforms six other geospatial foundation models when benchmarked on remote sensing tasks from different domains and resolutions (i.e. from 0.1m to 15m).\nDemo and inference\nWe provide a demo running Prithvi-EO-2.0-300M-TL here.\nThere is also an inference script (inference.py) that allows to run the image reconstruction on a set of HLS images assumed to be from the same location at different timestamps (see example below). These should be provided in chronological order in geotiff format, including the channels described above (Blue, Green, Red, Narrow NIR, SWIR 1, SWIR 2) in reflectance units.\npython inference.py --data_files t1.tif t2.tif t3.tif t4.tif --input_indices <optional, space separated 0-based indices of the six Prithvi channels in your input>\nFinetuning\nYou can finetune the model using TerraTorch.

To do this, you'll need to figure out how much RAM and/or VRAM you have.\nIf you want your model running as FAST as possible, you'll want to fit the whole thing on your GPU's VRAM. Aim for a quant with a file size 1-2GB smaller than your GPU's total VRAM.\nIf you want the absolute maximum quality, add both your system RAM and your GPU's VRAM together, then similarly grab a quant with a file size 1-2GB Smaller than that total.\nNext, you'll need to decide if you want to use an 'I-quant' or a 'K-quant'.\nIf you don't want to think too much, grab one of the K-quants. These are in format 'QX_K_X', like Q5_K_M.\nIf you want to get more into the weeds, you can check out this extremely useful feature chart:\nllama.cpp feature matrix\nBut basically, if you're aiming for below Q4, and you're running cuBLAS (Nvidia) or rocBLAS (AMD), you should look towards the I-quants. These are in format IQX_X, like IQ3_M. These are newer and offer better performance for their size.\nThese I-quants can also be used on CPU and Apple Metal, but will be slower than their K-quant equivalent, so speed vs performance is a tradeoff you'll have to decide.\nThe I-quants are not compatible with Vulcan, which is also AMD, so if you have an AMD card double check if you're using the rocBLAS build or the Vulcan build. At the time of writing this, LM Studio has a preview with ROCm support, and other inference engines have specific builds for ROCm.\nCredits\nThank you kalomaze and Dampf for assistance in creating the imatrix calibration dataset.\nThank you ZeroWw for the inspiration to experiment with embed/output.\nWant to support my work?

Visual language models (VLMs) have made significant advances in accuracy in recent years. However, their efficiency has received much less attention. This paper introduces NVILA, a family of open VLMs designed to optimize both efficiency and accuracy. Building on top of VILA, we improve its model architecture by first scaling up the spatial and temporal resolutions, and then compressing visual tokens. This \"scale-then-compress\" approach enables NVILA to efficiently process high-resolution images and long videos. We also conduct a systematic investigation to enhance the efficiency of NVILA throughout its entire lifecycle, from training and fine-tuning to deployment. NVILA matches or surpasses the accuracy of many leading open and proprietary VLMs across a wide range of image and video benchmarks. At the same time, it reduces training costs by 4.5X, fine-tuning memory usage by 3.4X, pre-filling latency by 1.6-2.2X, and decoding latency by 1.2-2.8X. We will soon make our code and models available to facilitate reproducibility.\nModel date:\nNVILA was trained in Nov 2024.\nPaper or resources for more information:\nhttps://github.com/NVLabs/VILA\n@misc{liu2024nvila,\ntitle={NVILA: Efficient Frontier Visual Language Models},\nauthor={Zhijian Liu and Ligeng Zhu and Baifeng Shi and Zhuoyang Zhang and Yuming Lou and Shang Yang and Haocheng Xi and Shiyi Cao and Yuxian Gu and Dacheng Li and Xiuyu Li and Yunhao Fang and Yukang Chen and Cheng-Yu Hsieh and De-An Huang and An-Chieh Cheng and Vishwesh Nath and Jinyi Hu and Sifei Liu and Ranjay Krishna and Daguang Xu and Xiaolong Wang and Pavlo Molchanov and Jan Kautz and Hongxu Yin and Song Han and Yao Lu},\nyear={2024},\neprint={2412.04468},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.CV},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04468},\n}\nLicense\nThe code is released under the Apache 2.0 license as found in the LICENSE file.\nThe pretrained weights are released under the CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license.\nThe service is a research preview intended for non-commercial use only, and is subject to the following licenses and terms:\nTerms of Use of the data generated by OpenAI\nDataset Licenses for each one used during training.\nWhere to send questions or comments about the model:\nhttps://github.com/NVLabs/VILA/issues\nIntended use\nPrimary intended uses:\nThe primary use of VILA is research on large multimodal models and chatbots.\nPrimary intended users:\nThe primary intended users of the model are researchers and hobbyists in computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.\nInput:\nInput Type: Image, Video, Text\nInput Format: Red, Green, Blue; MP4 ;String\nInput Parameters: 2D, 3D\nOutput:\nOutput Type: Text\nOutput Format: String\nSupported Hardware Microarchitecture Compatibility:\nAmpere\nJetson\nHopper\nLovelace\n[Preferred/Supported] Operating System(s):\nLinux\nTraining dataset\nSee Dataset Preparation for more details.\n** Data Collection Method by dataset\n[Hybrid: Automated, Human]\n** Labeling Method by dataset\n[Hybrid: Automated, Human]\nInference:\nEngine: [Tensor(RT), Triton, Or List Other Here]\nPyTorch\nTensorRT-LLM\nTinyChat\nTest Hardware:\nA100\nJetson Orin\nRTX 4090\nEthical Considerations\nNVIDIA believes Trustworthy AI is a shared responsibility and we have established policies and practices to enable development for a wide array of AI applications.

There are two reasons to use ESM-LogME:\nYou don't have enough training data for your problem\nIf you don't have a enough training data for your problem, just use ESM-LogME to find more.\nYou can supplement model training by including publicly available datasets in the training process.\nFine-tune a language model on suitable intermediate dataset.\nFine-tune the resulting model on your target dataset.\nThis workflow is called intermediate task transfer learning and it can significantly improve the target performance.\nBut what is a suitable dataset for your problem? ESM-LogME enable you to quickly rank thousands of datasets on the Hugging Face Hub by how well they are exptected to transfer to your target task.\nYou want to find similar datasets to your target dataset\nUsing ESM-LogME can be used like search engine on the Hugging Face Hub. You can find similar tasks to your target task without having to rely on heuristics. ESM-LogME estimates how language models fine-tuned on each intermediate task would benefinit your target task. This quantitative approach combines the effects of domain similarity and task similarity.\nHow can I use ESM-LogME / ESMs?\nWe release hf-dataset-selector, a Python package for intermediate task selection using Embedding Space Maps.\nhf-dataset-selector fetches ESMs for a given language model and uses it to find the best dataset for applying intermediate training to the target task.

They can be used to quickly transform embeddings from a base model to approximate how a fine-tuned model would embed the the input text.\nESMs can be used for intermediate task selection with the ESM-LogME workflow.\nHow can I use Embedding Space Maps for Intermediate Task Selection?\nCitation\nIf you are using this Embedding Space Maps, please cite our paper.\nBibTeX:\n@inproceedings{schulte-etal-2024-less,\ntitle = \"Less is More: Parameter-Efficient Selection of Intermediate Tasks for Transfer Learning\",\nauthor = \"Schulte, David  and\nHamborg, Felix  and\nAkbik, Alan\",\neditor = \"Al-Onaizan, Yaser  and\nBansal, Mohit  and\nChen, Yun-Nung\",\nbooktitle = \"Proceedings of the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\",\nmonth = nov,\nyear = \"2024\",\naddress = \"Miami, Florida, USA\",\npublisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\nurl = \"https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.529/\",\ndoi = \"10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.529\",\npages = \"9431--9442\",\nabstract = \"Intermediate task transfer learning can greatly improve model performance. If, for example, one has little training data for emotion detection, first fine-tuning a language model on a sentiment classification dataset may improve performance strongly. But which task to choose for transfer learning? Prior methods producing useful task rankings are infeasible for large source pools, as they require forward passes through all source language models. We overcome this by introducing Embedding Space Maps (ESMs), light-weight neural networks that approximate the effect of fine-tuning a language model. We conduct the largest study on NLP task transferability and task selection with 12k source-target pairs. We find that applying ESMs on a prior method reduces execution time and disk space usage by factors of 10 and 278, respectively, while retaining high selection performance (avg. regret@5 score of 2.95).\"\n}\nAPA:\nSchulte, D., Hamborg, F., & Akbik, A.

As a result, it may generate outputs that are inappropriate, misleading, biased, or unsafe. These risks can be mitigated through additional post-training stages, which is strongly recommended before deployment in any production system, especially for high-stakes applications.\nALIA-40b Model Card\nALIA-40b is a highly multilingual model pre-trained from scratch that will come with its respective base and instruction-tuned variants. This model card corresponds to the 40b base version.\nTo visit the model cards of other model versions, please refer to the Model Index.\nThis model is released under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.\nAlong with the open weights, all training scripts and configuration files are made publicly available in this GitHub repository.\nModel Details\nDescription\nTransformer-based decoder-only language model that has been pre-trained from scratch on 9.37 trillion tokens of highly curated data.\nThe pre-training corpus contains text in 35 European languages and code.\nHyperparameters\nThe full list of hyperparameters can be found here.\nArchitecture\nTotal Parameters\n40,433,885,184\nEmbedding Parameters\n2,097,152,000\nLayers\n48\nHidden size\n8,192\nAttention heads\n64\nContext length\n32,768\nVocabulary size\n256,000\nPrecision\nbfloat16\nEmbedding type\nRoPE\nActivation Function\nSwiGLU\nLayer normalization\nRMS Norm\nFlash attention\n✅\nGrouped Query Attention\n✅\nNum. query groups\n8\nIntended Use\nDirect Use\nThe models are intended for both research and commercial use in any of the languages included in the training data.\nThe base models are intended either for language generation or to be further fine-tuned for specific use-cases.\nThe instruction-tuned variants can be used as general-purpose assistants, as long as the user is fully aware of the model’s limitations.\nOut-of-scope Use\nThe model is not intended for malicious activities, such as harming others or violating human rights.\nAny downstream application must comply with current laws and regulations.\nIrresponsible usage in production environments without proper risk assessment and mitigation is also discouraged.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Framework\nPre-training was conducted using NVIDIA’s NeMo Framework,\nwhich leverages PyTorch Lightning for efficient model training in highly distributed settings.\nThe instruction-tuned versions were produced with FastChat.\nCompute Infrastructure\nAll models were trained on MareNostrum 5, a pre-exascale EuroHPC supercomputer hosted and\noperated by Barcelona Supercomputing Center.\nThe accelerated partition is composed of 1,120 nodes with the following specifications:\n4x Nvidia Hopper GPUs with 64GB HBM2 memory\n2x Intel Sapphire Rapids 8460Y+ at 2.3Ghz and 32c each (64 cores)\n4x NDR200 (BW per node 800Gb/s)\n512 GB of Main memory (DDR5)\n460GB on NVMe storage\nModel\nNodes\nGPUs\n2B\n64\n256\n7B\n128\n512\n40B\n256 / 512\n1,024 / 2,048\nHow to use\nThis section offers examples of how to perform inference using various methods.\nInference\nYou'll find different techniques for running inference, including Huggingface's Text Generation Pipeline, multi-GPU configurations, and vLLM for scalable and efficient generation.\nInference with Huggingface's Text Generation Pipeline\nThe Huggingface Text Generation Pipeline provides a straightforward way to run inference using the ALIA-40b model.\npip install transformers torch accelerate sentencepiece protobuf\nShow code\nfrom transformers import pipeline, set_seed\nmodel_id = \"BSC-LT/ALIA-40b\"\n# Sample prompts\nprompts = [\n\"Las fiestas de San Isidro Labrador de Yecla son\",\n\"El punt més alt del Parc Natural del Montseny és\",\n\"Sentence in English: The typical chance of such a storm is around 10%.

This way, we downsampled code and English data to half,\nSpanish co-official languages were oversampled by 2x, and the remaining languages were kept in their original proportions.\nDuring the following training, the Colossal OSCAR dataset was replaced with the FineWeb-Edu dataset.\nThis adjustment resulted in a total of 2.68 trillion tokens used across 2 epochs, distributed as outlined below:\nThe pretraining corpus is predominantly composed of data from Colossal OSCAR, which contributes a significant 53.05% of the total tokens.\nFollowing this, Starcoder provides 13.67%, and FineWeb-Edu (350B tokens subset) adds 10.24%. The next largest sources are HPLT at 4.21% and French-PD at 3.59%.\nOther notable contributions include MaCoCu, Legal-ES, and EurLex, each contributing around 1.72% to 1.41%.\nThese major sources collectively form the bulk of the corpus, ensuring a rich and diverse dataset for training the language model.\nThe remaining 10% comes from smaller sources in various languages.\nFeel free to click the expand button below to see the full list of sources.\nData Sources\nDataset\nLanguage\nSource\nColossal OSCAR 1.0\nbg, ca, cs, cy, da, de, el, en, es, et, eu, fi, fr, ga, gl, hr, hu, it, lt, lv, mt, nl, nn, no, oc, pl, pt, ro, ru, sh, sk, sl, sr, sv, uk\nBrack et al., 2024\nAya Dataset (w/o Evaluation Suite)\neu, hr, nl, fi, ka, hu, lt, nn, ro, sk, lv, cy, bg, cs, en, fr, de, ga, mt, pl, ru, sl, sv, ca, da, et, gl, el, it, no, pt, sr, es, uk\nSingh et al., 2024\nWikimedia dumps\nbg, ca, cs, da, de, el, en, es, et, eu, fi, fr, ga, gl, hr, hu, it, lt, lv, mt, nl, nn, no, pl, pt, ro, sh, sk, sl, sr, uk\nLink\nOpenSubtitles v2016\nbg, ca, cs, da, de, el, en, es, et, eu, fi, fr, gl, hr, it, lt, lv, nl, no, pl, pt, ro, sk, sl, sr, sv, uk\nLison & Tiedemann, 2016\nEurLEX-Resources\nbg, cs, da, de, el, en, es, et, fi, fr, ga, hr, hu, it, lt, lv, mt, nl, pl, pt, ro, sk, sl, sv\nLink\nMC4-Legal\nbg, cs, da, de, el, en, es, et, fi, fr, ga, hu, it, lt, lv, mt, nl, pl, pt, ro, sk, sl, sv\nLink\nParlamint\nat, bg, cz, dk, ee, es, es-ga, fi, fr, gb, gr, hr, hu, it, lv, nl, no, pl, pt, rs, se, si\nErjavec et al., 2021\nMaCoCu\nbg, ca, el, hr, mt, sl, sr, uk\nBañón et al., 2022\nCURLICAT\nbg, hr, hu, pl, ro, sk, sl\nVáradi et al., 2022\nNorwegian Colossal Corpus (NCC)\nnn, no\nKummervold et al., 2021\nAcademic Slovene KAS 2.0\nsl\nŽagar et al., 2022\nBIGPATENT\nen\nSharma et al., 2019\nBiomedical-ES\nes\nInternally generated biomedical dataset: Wikipedia LS, Pubmed, MeSpEn, patents, clinical cases, medical crawler\nBrazilian Portuguese Web as Corpus (BrWaC)\npt\nWagner Filho et al., 2018\nBulgarian National Corpus (BulNC)\nbg\nLink\nCaBeRnet\nfr\nPopa-Fabre et al., 2020\nCATalog 1.0\nca\nPalomar-Giner et al., 2024\nCATalog 1.0-va\nca\nBOUA, DOGC, DOGV, Les Corts Valencianes, provided by CENID\nCorpusNÓS\ngl\nde-Dios-Flores et al., 2024\nCroatian Web as Corpus 2.1 (hrWaC)\nhr\nLjubešić & Klubička, 2014\nDaNewsroom\nda\nVarab & Schluter, 2020\nDanish GigaWord\nda\nStrømberg-Derczynski et al., 2021\nDolmino-mix-1124 (subset without synthetically generated data and privative licenses)\nen\nTeam OLMo, 2024\nDK-CLARIN Reference Corpus of General Danish\nda\nLink\nEstonian National Corpus 2021 (ENC)\net\nKoppel & Kallas, 2022\nEstonian Reference Corpus (ERC)\net\nLink\nEusCrawl (w/o Wikipedia or NC-licenses)\neu\nArtetxe et al., 2022\nFineWeb-Edu (350BT subset)\nen\nPenedo et al., 2024\nFineweb2 (ad hoc subset of 178BT)\nar, as, bg, ca, cs, cy, da, de, el, es, et, eu, fi, fr, ga, gl, hr, hu, it, lt, lv, mt, nl, nn, no, oc, pl, pt, ro, ru, sk, sl, sr, sv, uk\nPenedo et al., 2024\nFrench Public Domain Books (French-PD)\nfr\nLink\nFrench Public Domain Newspapers (French-PD)\nfr\nLink\nGerman Web as Corpus (DeWaC)\nde\nLink\nGreek Legal Code (GLC)\nel\nPapaloukas et al., 2021\nGreek Web Corpus (GWC)\nel\nOutsios et al., 2018\nHPLT v1 -

Aya Dataset: An Open-Access Collection for Multilingual Instruction Tuning (arXiv:2402.06619). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06619\nIn the final pre-training phase, we used a high-quality subset of 160 billion tokens. Additionally, to expand the model's context window to 32K, 6.3 billion tokens were processed using the Llama 3.1 RoPE interpolation strategy.\nWe provide an extense Datasheet section following the best practices defined by (Gebru et al., 2021).\nDatasheet\nMotivation\nFor what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.\nThe purpose of creating this dataset is to pre-train the Salamandra family of multilingual models with high performance in a large number of European languages (35)\nand programming languages (92). We also want to represent the co-official languages of Spain: Spanish, Catalan, Galician and Basque. For this reason, we oversample\nthese languages by a factor of 2.\nThere is a great lack of massive multilingual data, especially in minority languages (Ostendorff & Rehm, 2023), so part of our efforts in the creation of\nthis pre-training dataset have resulted in the contribution to large projects such as the Community OSCAR (Brack et al., 2024), which includes 151 languages\nand 40T words, or CATalog (Palomar-Giner et al., 2024), the largest open dataset in Catalan in the world.\nWho created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?\nThe dataset has been created by the Language Technologies unit (LangTech) of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional de Supercomputación (BSC-CNS),\nwhich aims to advance the field of natural language processing through cutting-edge research and development and the use of HPC. In particular, it was created by\nthe unit's data team, the main contributors being José Javier Saiz, Ferran Espuña and Jorge Palomar.\nHowever, the creation of the dataset would not have been possible without the collaboration of a large number of collaborators, partners and public institutions,\nwhich can be found in detail in the acknowledgements.\nWho funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.\nThis work has been promoted and financed by the Government of Catalonia through the Aina project.\nThis work is funded by the Ministerio para la Transformación Digital y de la Función Pública - Funded by EU – NextGenerationEU\nwithin the framework of ILENIA Project with reference 2022/TL22/00215337.\nComposition\nWhat do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.\nThe dataset consists entirely of text documents in various languages. Specifically, data was mainly sourced from the following databases and\nrepositories:\nCommon Crawl: Repository that holds website data and is run by the Common Crawl non-profit organization. It is updated monthly and is\ndistributed under the CC0 1.0 public domain license.\nGitHub: Community platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. Repositories are crawled and then\ndistributed with their original licenses, which may vary from permissive to non-commercial licenses.\nWikimedia: Database that holds the collection databases managed by the Wikimedia Foundation, including Wikipedia, Wikibooks, Wikinews,\nWikiquote, Wikisource, and Wikivoyage. It is updated monthly and is distributed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.\nEurLex: Repository that holds the collection of legal documents from the European Union, available in all of the EU’s 24 official\nlanguages and run by the Publications Office of the European Union. It is updated daily and is distributed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution 4.0 International license.\nOther repositories: Specific repositories were crawled under permission for domain-specific corpora, which include academic, legal,\nand newspaper repositories.\nWe provide a complete list of dataset sources at the end of this section.\nHow many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?\nThe dataset contains a diverse range of instances across multiple languages, with notable adjustments for certain languages. English\nrepresents the largest portion, accounting for 39.31% of the total data. Spanish was upsampled by a factor of 2, bringing its share to 16.12%,\nwhile Catalan (1.97%), Basque (0.24%), and Galician (0.31%) were also upsampled by 2. On the other hand, code-related data was downsampled\nby half, making up 5.78% of the total. Other prominent languages include French (6.6%), Russian (5.56%), German (4.79%), and Hungarian\n(4.59%), with several additional languages contributing between 1% and 2%, and smaller portions represented by a variety of others.\nDoes the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).\nThe dataset is a sample from multiple sources, with different weights based on the primary language of the content: Spanish, Catalan,\nBasque, and Galician content was upsampled by a factor of two, while programming languages were downsampled by a factor of half. Other\nsources were sampled in proportion to their occurrence.\nWhat data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.\nEach instance consists of a text document processed for deduplication, language identification, and source-specific filtering. Some documents required\noptical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from non-text formats such as PDFs.\nIs there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.\nEach instance is labelled with a unique identifier, the primary language of the content, and the URL for web-sourced instances. Additional labels were\nautomatically assigned to detect specific types of content -harmful or toxic content- and to assign preliminary indicators of undesired qualities -very\nshort documents, high density of symbols, etc.- which were used for filtering instances.\nIs any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text.\nNo significant information is missing from the instances.\nAre relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.\nInstances are related through shared metadata, such as source and language identifiers.\nAre there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.\nThe dataset is randomly divided into training, validation and test sets, where the validation and test sets are each 1% of the total corpus.\nAre there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.\nDespite removing duplicated instances within each source, redundancy remains at the paragraph and sentence levels, particularly in web-sourced\ninstances where search engine optimization techniques and templates contribute to repeated textual patterns. Some instances may be also duplicated\nacross sources due to format variations.\nIs the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.\nThe dataset is self-contained and does not rely on external resources.\nDoes the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.\nThe dataset does not contain confidential data.\nDoes the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why. If the dataset does not relate to people, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.\nThe dataset includes web-crawled content, which may overrepresent pornographic material across languages (Kreutzer et al., 2022). Although\npre-processing techniques were applied to mitigate offensive content, the heterogeneity and scale of web-sourced data make exhaustive\nfiltering challenging, which makes it next to impossible to identify all adult content without falling into excessive filtering, which may\nnegatively influence certain demographic groups (Dodge et al., 2021).\nDoes the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.\nThe dataset does not explicitly identify any subpopulations.\nIs it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.\nWeb-sourced instances in the dataset may contain personally identifiable information (PII) that is publicly available on the Web, such as names,\nIP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. While it would be possible to indirectly identify individuals through the combination of multiple\ndata points, the nature and scale of web data makes it difficult to parse such information. In any case, efforts are made to filter or anonymize\nsensitive data (Mina et al., 2024), but some identifiable information may remain in the dataset.\nDoes the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way? If so, please provide a description.\nGiven that the dataset includes web-sourced content and other publicly available documents, instances may inadvertently reveal financial\ninformation, health-related details, or forms of government identification, such as social security numbers (Subramani et al., 2023),\nespecially if the content originates from less-regulated sources or user-generated platforms.\nCollection Process\nHow was the data collected?\nThis dataset is constituted by combining several sources, whose acquisition methods can be classified into three groups:\nWeb-sourced datasets with some preprocessing available under permissive license.\nDomain-specific or language-specific raw crawls.\nManually curated data obtained through collaborators, data providers (by means of legal assignment agreements) or open source projects (e.g. CATalog).\nWhat mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?\nThe data collection process was carried out using three different mechanisms, each corresponding to one of the groups defined in the previous answer. The specific methods used and their respective validation procedures are outlined below:\nOpen Direct Download: Data were obtained directly from publicly accessible sources, such as websites or repositories that provide open data downloads. We validate the data with a data integrity check, which ensures that the downloaded files are complete, uncorrupted and in the expected format and structure.\nAd hoc scrapers or crawlers: Custom web scraping scripts or crawlers were used to extract data from various online sources where direct downloads were not available. These scripts navigate web pages, extract relevant data and store it in a structured format. We validate this method with software unit tests to evaluate the functionality of individual components of the scraping programs, checking for errors or unexpected behaviour. In addition, data integrity tests were performed to verify that the collected data remained complete throughout the extraction and storage process.\nDirect download via FTP, SFTP, API or S3: Some datasets were acquired using secure transfer protocols such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol), or API (Application Programming Interface) requests from cloud storage services such as Amazon S3. As with the open direct download method, data integrity tests were used to validate the completeness of the files to ensure that the files were not altered or corrupted during the transfer process.\nIf the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy?\nThe sampling strategy was to use the whole dataset resulting from the filtering explained in the 'preprocessing/cleaning/labelling' section,\nwith the particularity that an upsampling of 2 (i.e. twice the probability of sampling a document) was performed for the co-official languages\nof Spain (Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Basque), and a downsampling of 1/2 was applied for code (half the probability of sampling a code document,\nevenly distributed among all programming languages).\nWho was involved in the data collection process and how were they compensated?\nThis data is generally extracted, filtered and sampled by automated processes. The code required to run these processes has been developed entirely\nby members of the Language Technologies data team, or otherwise obtained from open-source software. Furthermore, there has been no monetary\nconsideration for acquiring data from suppliers.\nOver what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.\nData were acquired and processed from April 2023 to April 2024. However, as mentioned, much data has been obtained from open projects such\nas Common Crawl, which contains data from 2014, so it is the end date (04/2024) rather than the start date that is important.\nWere any ethical review processes conducted? If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.\nNo particular ethical review process has been carried out as the data is mostly open and not particularly sensitive. However, we have an\ninternal evaluation team and a bias team to monitor ethical issues. In addition, we work closely with ‘Observatori d'Ètica en Intel·ligència\nArtificial’ (OEIAC) and  ‘Agencia Española de Supervisión de la Inteligencia Artificial’ (AESIA) to audit the processes we carry out from an\nethical and legal point of view, respectively.\nPreprocessing\nWas any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.\nNo changes were made to the content of individual text document instances. However, the web-sourced documents underwent a filtering process based on specific criteria along two key dimensions:\nQuality filtering: The text processing pipeline CURATE (Palomar et. al, 2024) calculates a quality score for each document based on a set of filtering criteria that identify undesirable textual characteristics. Any document with a score below the 0.8 threshold was excluded from the dataset.\nHarmful or adult content filtering: To reduce the amount of harmful or inappropriate material in the dataset, documents from Colossal OSCAR were filtered using the Ungoliant pipeline (Abadji et al., 2021), which uses the 'harmful_pp' field, a perplexity-based score generated by a language model.\nWas the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data? If so, please provide a link or other access point to the “raw” data.\nThe original raw data was not kept.\nIs the software that was used to preprocess/clean/label the data available? If so, please provide a link or other access point.\nYes, the preprocessing and filtering software is open-sourced. The CURATE pipeline was used for CATalog and other curated datasets,\nand the Ungoliant pipeline was used for the OSCAR project.\nUses\nHas the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, please provide a description.\nPre-train the Salamandra model family.\nWhat (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?\nThe data can be used primarily to pre-train other language models, which can then be used for a wide range of use cases. The dataset could\nalso be used for other tasks such as fine-tuning language models, cross-lingual NLP tasks, machine translation, domain-specific text\ngeneration, and language-specific data analysis.\nIs there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms?\nWeb-crawled content is over-represented with standard language varieties, impacting language model performance for minority languages.\nLanguage diversity in data is crucial to avoid bias, especially in encoding non-standard dialects, preventing the exclusion of demographic\ngroups. Moreover, despite legal uncertainties in web-scraped data, we prioritize permissive licenses and privacy protection measures,\nacknowledging the challenges posed by personally identifiable information (PII) within large-scale datasets. Our ongoing efforts aim to\naddress privacy concerns and contribute to a more inclusive linguistic dataset.\nAre there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?\nDistribution\nWill the dataset be distributed to third parties outside of the entity on behalf of which the dataset was created? If so, please provide a description.\nThe dataset will not be released or distributed to third parties. Any related question to distribution is omitted in this section.\nMaintenance\nWho will be supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?\nThe dataset will be hosted by the Language Technologies unit (LangTech) of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). The team will ensure\nregular updates and monitor the dataset for any issues related to content integrity, legal compliance, and bias for the sources they are\nresponsible for.\nHow can the owner/curator/manager of the dataset be contacted?\nThe data owner may be contacted with the email address langtech@bsc.es.\nWill the dataset be updated?\nThe dataset will not be updated.\nIf the dataset relates to people, are there applicable limits on the retention of the data associated with the instances? If so, please describe these limits and explain how they will be enforced.\nThe dataset does not keep sensitive data that could allow direct identification of individuals, apart from the data that is publicly available in\nweb-sourced content. Due to the sheer volume and diversity of web data, it is not feasible to notify individuals or manage data retention on an\nindividual basis. However, efforts are made to mitigate the risks associated with sensitive information through pre-processing and filtering to\nremove identifiable or harmful content. Despite these measures, vigilance is maintained to address potential privacy and ethical issues.\nWill older versions of the dataset continue to be supported/hosted/maintained? If so, please describe how. If not, please describe how its obsolescence will be communicated to dataset consumers.\nSince the dataset will not be updated, only the final version will be kept.\nIf others want to extend/augment/build on/contribute to the dataset, is there a mechanism for them to do so?\nThe dataset does not allow for external contributions.\nEvaluation\nGold-standard benchmarks\nEvaluation is done using the Language Model Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2024). We evaluate on a set of tasks taken from SpanishBench, CatalanBench, BasqueBench and GalicianBench. We also use English tasks already available on the LM Evaluation Harness. These benchmarks include both new and existing tasks and datasets. In the tables below, we include the results in a selection of evaluation datasets that represent model's performance across a variety of tasks within these benchmarks.\nWe only use tasks that are either human generated, human translated, or with a strong human-in-the-loop (i.e., machine translation followed by professional revision or machine generation followed by human revision and annotation). This is the reason behind the variety in number of tasks reported across languages. As more tasks that fulfill these requirements are published, we will update the presented results. We also intend to expand the evaluation to other languages, as long as the datasets meet our quality standards.\nDuring the implementation of the evaluation we observed a series of issues worth considering when replicating and interpreting the results presented. These issues include ≈1.5% variances in performance in some tasks depending on the version of the transformers library used, and depending on the use (or lack of use) of tensor parallelism when loading a model. When implementing existing tasks, we carry out a comprehensive quality evaluation of the dataset, the Harness task itself, and what kind of input models see during evaluation. Our implementation (see links above) addresses multiple existing problems such as errors in datasets and prompts, and lack of pre-processing. All this means that results will vary if using other Harness implementations, and may slightly vary depending on the replication setup.\nIt should be noted that these results are subject to all the drawbacks of every current gold-standard evaluation, and that the figures do not fully represent the model's capabilities and potential. We thus advise caution when reading and interpreting the results.\nA full list of results compared to other baselines, a discussion of the model's performance across tasks and its implications, and details regarding problem-solving with task implementation will soon be available in the technical report.\nAll results reported below are on a 5-shot setting.\nSpanish\nCategory\nTask\nMetric\nResult\nCommonsense Reasoning\nxstorycloze_es\nacc\n79.5\nNLI\nwnli_es\nacc\n64.8\nxnli_es\nacc\n50.4\nParaphrasing\npaws_es\nacc\n63.8\nQA\nxquad_es\nacc\n73.4\nTranslation\nflores_es\nbleu\n25.9\nCatalan\nCategory\nTask\nMetric\nResult\nCommonsense Reasoning\ncopa_ca\nacc\n86.0\nxstorycloze_ca\nacc\n80.0\nNLI\nwnli_ca\nacc\n70.0\nxnli_ca\nacc\n50.7\nParaphrasing\nparafraseja\nacc\n67.8\npaws_ca\nacc\n67.5\nQA\narc_ca_easy\nacc\n81.0\narc_ca_challenge\nacc\n53.0\nopenbookqa_ca\nacc\n41.6\npiqa_ca\nacc\n75.8\nsiqa_ca\nacc\n53.9\nTranslation\nflores_ca\nbleu\n33.7\nBasque\nCategory\nTask\nMetric\nResult\nCommonsense Reasoning\nxcopa_eu\nacc\n78.8\nxstorycloze_eu\nacc\n72.2\nNLI\nwnli_eu\nacc\n66.2\nxnli_eu\nacc\n45.9\nQA\neus_exams\nacc\n61.5\neus_proficiency\nacc\n60.4\neus_trivia\nacc\n67.2\nReading Comprehension\neus_reading\nacc\n61.1\nTranslation\nflores_eu\nbleu\n21.3\nGalician\nCategory\nTask\nMetric\nResult\nParaphrasing\nparafrases_gl\nacc\n60.2\npaws_gl\nacc\n63.0\nQA\nopenbookqa_gl\nacc\n36.6\nTranslation\nflores_gl\nbleu\n31.2\nEnglish\nCategory\nTask\nMetric\nResult\nCommonsense Reasoning\ncopa\nacc\n94.0\nxstorycloze_en\nacc\n83.2\nNLI\nwnli\nacc\n67.6\nxnli_en\nacc\n57.0\nParaphrasing\npaws *\nacc\n68.5\nQA\narc_easy\nacc\n86.5\narc_challenge\nacc\n59.4\nopenbookqa\nacc\n38.4\npiqa\nacc\n81.7\nsocial_iqa\nacc\n53.8\nxquad_en\nacc\n80.7\n* Current LM Evaluation Harness implementation is lacking correct pre-processing. These results are obtained with adequate pre-processing.\nLong Context Evaluation\nTo assess the long-context capabilities of our model, we conduct a \"needle in a haystack\" test with the following configuration:\nNeedle Phrase: \"The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.\"\nRetrieval Question: \"The best thing to do in San Francisco is\"\nEvaluator: prometheus-8x7b-v2.0, used as the evaluation judge.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nWe examine the presence of undesired societal and cognitive biases present in this model using different benchmarks. For societal biases, we test performance using our Spanish version of the BBQ dataset (Parrish et al., 2022). We report that while accuracy in disambiguated settings is relatively high for a base model, the model performs very poorly in ambiguous settings. Further examination of the differences in accuracy scores as described in Jin et al. (2024) reveals a low-to-moderate alignment between the model's responses and societal biases. These largely vanish in disambiguated setting. Our analyses on societal biases show that while these biases are capable of interfering with model performance as expressed in the results on the BBQ dataset, their interference with task performance is somewhat limited given the results on the disambiguated dataset. We highlight that our analyses of these biases are by no means exhaustive and are limited by the relative scarcity of adequate resources in all languages present in the training data. We aim to gradually extend and expand our analyses in future work.\nOur cognitive bias analysis focuses on positional effects in 0-shot settings, and majority class bias in few-shot settings. For positional effects, we leverage the ARC Multiple Choice Question dataset (Clark et al., 2018). We observe weak primacy effects, whereby the model shows a preference for answers towards the beginning of the list of provided answers. We measure the effects of majority class effects in few-shot settings using SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013). We detect significant effects, albeit extremely weak ones, implying that outputs are generally robust against variations in prompt format, and order.\nWe highlight that these results can be expected from a pretrained model that has not yet been instruction-tuned or aligned. These tests are performed in order to show the biases the model may contain. We urge developers to take them into account and perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.\nAdditional information\nAuthor\nThe Language Technologies Lab from Barcelona Supercomputing Center.\nContact\nFor further information, please send an email to langtech@bsc.es.\nCopyright\nCopyright(c) 2025 by Language Technologies Lab, Barcelona Supercomputing Center.\nFunding\nThis work is funded by the Ministerio para la Transformación Digital y de la Función Pública - Funded by EU – NextGenerationEU within the framework of the project Modelos del Lenguaje.\nThis work has been promoted and supported by the Government of Catalonia through the Aina Project.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project has benefited from the contributions of numerous teams and institutions, mainly through data contributions, knowledge transfer or technical support.\nWe are especially grateful to our ILENIA project partners: CENID, HiTZ and CiTIUS for their participation.

The HuggingFace demo and models (virtual try-on model trained on VITON-HD and pose transfer model trained on DeepFashion) are released.\n11/Dec/2024. The arXiv version of the paper is released.\nLeffa is a unified framework for controllable person image generation that enables precise manipulation of both appearance (i.e., virtual try-on) and pose (i.e., pose transfer).\nAbstract\nControllable person image generation aims to generate a person image conditioned on reference images, allowing precise control over the person’s appearance or pose. However, prior methods often distort fine-grained textural details from the reference image, despite achieving high overall image quality. We attribute these distortions to inadequate attention to corresponding regions in the reference image. To address this, we thereby propose learning flow fields in attention (Leffa), which explicitly guides the target query to attend to the correct reference key in the attention layer during training. Specifically, it is realized via a regularization loss on top of the attention map within a diffusion-based baseline. Our extensive experiments show that Leffa achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling appearance (virtual try-on) and pose (pose transfer), significantly reducing fine-grained detail distortion while maintaining high image quality. Additionally, we show that our loss is model-agnostic and can be used to improve the performance of other diffusion models.\nMethod\nAn overview of our Leffa training pipeline for controllable person image generation. The left is our diffusion-based baseline; the right is our Leffa loss. Note that Isrc and Itgt are the same image during training.\nVisualization\nQualitative visual results comparison with other methods. The input person image for the pose transfer is generated using our method in the virtual try-on.
