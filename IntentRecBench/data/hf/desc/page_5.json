This is the repository for the 7B fine-tuned model, optimized for dialogue use cases and converted for the Hugging Face Transformers format. Links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom.\nModel Details\nNote: Use of this model is governed by the Meta license. In order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the website and accept our License before requesting access here.\nMeta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.\nModel Developers Meta\nVariations Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes — 7B, 13B, and 70B — as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.\nInput Models input text only.\nOutput Models generate text only.\nModel Architecture Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\nTraining Data\nParams\nContent Length\nGQA\nTokens\nLR\nLlama 2\nA new mix of publicly available online data\n7B\n4k\n✗\n2.0T\n3.0 x 10-4\nLlama 2\nA new mix of publicly available online data\n13B\n4k\n✗\n2.0T\n3.0 x 10-4\nLlama 2\nA new mix of publicly available online data\n70B\n4k\n✔\n2.0T\n1.5 x 10-4\nLlama 2 family of models. Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models -  70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\nModel Dates Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.\nStatus This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\nLicense A custom commercial license is available at: https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/\nResearch Paper \"Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models\"\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\nTo get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the INST and <<SYS>> tags, BOS and EOS tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling strip() on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: chat_completion.\nOut-of-scope Uses Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\nCarbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\nTime (GPU hours)\nPower Consumption (W)\nCarbon Emitted(tCO2eq)\nLlama 2 7B\n184320\n400\n31.22\nLlama 2 13B\n368640\n400\n62.44\nLlama 2 70B\n1720320\n400\n291.42\nTotal\n3311616\n539.00\nCO2 emissions during pretraining. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\nData Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.\nEvaluation Results\nIn this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 models on standard academic benchmarks.For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.\nModel\nSize\nCode\nCommonsense Reasoning\nWorld Knowledge\nReading Comprehension\nMath\nMMLU\nBBH\nAGI Eval\nLlama 1\n7B\n14.1\n60.8\n46.2\n58.5\n6.95\n35.1\n30.3\n23.9\nLlama 1\n13B\n18.9\n66.1\n52.6\n62.3\n10.9\n46.9\n37.0\n33.9\nLlama 1\n33B\n26.0\n70.0\n58.4\n67.6\n21.4\n57.8\n39.8\n41.7\nLlama 1\n65B\n30.7\n70.7\n60.5\n68.6\n30.8\n63.4\n43.5\n47.6\nLlama 2\n7B\n16.8\n63.9\n48.9\n61.3\n14.6\n45.3\n32.6\n29.3\nLlama 2\n13B\n24.5\n66.9\n55.4\n65.8\n28.7\n54.8\n39.4\n39.1\nLlama 2\n70B\n37.5\n71.9\n63.6\n69.4\n35.2\n68.9\n51.2\n54.2\nOverall performance on grouped academic benchmarks.

Same metric definitions as above.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nLlama 2 is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/\nReporting Issues\nPlease report any software “bug,” or other problems with the models through one of the following means:\nReporting issues with the model: github.com/facebookresearch/llama\nReporting problematic content generated by the model: developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback\nReporting bugs and security concerns: facebook.com/whitehat/info\nLlama Model Index\nModel\nLlama2\nLlama2-hf\nLlama2-chat\nLlama2-chat-hf\n7B\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\n13B\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\n70B\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink",

Instruction tuned text only models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks. The Llama 3.1 model collection also supports the ability to leverage the outputs of its models to improve other models including synthetic data generation and distillation. The Llama 3.1 Community License allows for these use cases.\nOut-of-scope Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3.1 Community License. Use in languages beyond those explicitly referenced as supported in this model card**.\n**Note: Llama 3.1 has been trained on a broader collection of languages than the 8 supported languages. Developers may fine-tune Llama 3.1 models for languages beyond the 8 supported languages provided they comply with the Llama 3.1 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy and in such cases are responsible for ensuring that any uses of Llama 3.1 in additional languages is done in a safe and responsible manner.\nHow to use\nThis repository contains two versions of Meta's Llama-3.1-8B, for use with transformers and with the original llama codebase.\nUse with transformers\nStarting with transformers >= 4.43.0 onward, you can run conversational inference using the Transformers pipeline abstraction or by leveraging the Auto classes with the generate() function.\nMake sure to update your transformers installation via pip install --upgrade transformers.\nimport transformers\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B\"\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n\"text-generation\", model=model_id, model_kwargs={\"torch_dtype\": torch.bfloat16}, device_map=\"auto\"\n)\npipeline(\"Hey how are you doing today?\")\nUse with llama\nPlease, follow the instructions in the repository.\nTo download Original checkpoints, see the example command below leveraging huggingface-cli:\nhuggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B --include \"original/*\" --local-dir Llama-3.1-8B\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's custom built GPU cluster, and production infrastructure for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on production infrastructure.\nTraining utilized a cumulative of 39.3M GPU hours of computation on H100-80GB (TDP of 700W) type hardware, per the table below. Training time is the total GPU time required for training each model and power consumption is the peak power capacity per GPU device used, adjusted for power usage efficiency.\nTraining Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimated total location-based greenhouse gas emissions were 11,390 tons CO2eq for training. Since 2020, Meta has maintained net zero greenhouse gas emissions in its global operations and matched 100% of its electricity use with renewable energy, therefore the total market-based greenhouse gas emissions for training were 0 tons CO2eq.\nTraining Time (GPU hours)\nTraining Power Consumption (W)\nTraining Location-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n(tons CO2eq)\nTraining Market-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n(tons CO2eq)\nLlama 3.1 8B\n1.46M\n700\n420\n0\nLlama 3.1 70B\n7.0M\n700\n2,040\n0\nLlama 3.1 405B\n30.84M\n700\n8,930\n0\nTotal\n39.3M\n11,390\n0\nThe methodology used to determine training energy use and greenhouse gas emissions can be found here.

Our approach is to build the most helpful models enabling the world to benefit from the technology power, by aligning our model safety for the generic use cases addressing a standard set of harms. Developers are then in the driver seat to tailor safety for their use case, defining their own policy and deploying the models with the necessary safeguards in their Llama systems. Llama 3.1 was developed following the best practices outlined in our Responsible Use Guide, you can refer to the Responsible Use Guide to learn more.\nLlama 3.1 instruct\nOur main objectives for conducting safety fine-tuning are to provide the research community with a valuable resource for studying the robustness of safety fine-tuning, as well as to offer developers a readily available, safe, and powerful model for various applications to reduce the developer workload to deploy safe AI systems. For more details on the safety mitigations implemented please read the Llama 3 paper.\nFine-tuning data\nWe employ a multi-faceted approach to data collection, combining human-generated data from our vendors with synthetic data to mitigate potential safety risks. We’ve developed many large language model (LLM)-based classifiers that enable us to thoughtfully select high-quality prompts and responses, enhancing data quality control.\nRefusals and Tone\nBuilding on the work we started with Llama 3, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts as well as refusal tone. We included both borderline and adversarial prompts in our safety data strategy, and modified our safety data responses to follow  tone guidelines.\nLlama 3.1 systems\nLarge language models, including Llama 3.1, are not designed to be deployed in isolation but instead should be deployed as part of an overall AI system with additional safety guardrails as required. Developers are expected to deploy system safeguards when building agentic systems. Safeguards are key to achieve the right helpfulness-safety alignment as well as mitigating safety and security risks inherent to the system and any integration of the model or system with external tools.\nAs part of our responsible release approach, we provide the community with safeguards that developers should deploy with Llama models or other LLMs, including Llama Guard 3, Prompt Guard and Code Shield. All our reference implementations demos contain these safeguards by default so developers can benefit from system-level safety out-of-the-box.\nNew capabilities\nNote that this release introduces new capabilities, including a longer context window, multilingual inputs and outputs and possible integrations by developers with third party tools. Building with these new capabilities requires specific considerations in addition to the best practices that generally apply across all Generative AI use cases.\nTool-use: Just like in standard software development, developers are responsible for the integration of the LLM with the tools and services of their choice. They should define a clear policy for their use case and assess the integrity of the third party services they use to be aware of the safety and security limitations when using this capability. Refer to the Responsible Use Guide for best practices on the safe deployment of the third party safeguards.\nMultilinguality: Llama 3.1 supports 7 languages in addition to English: French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai. Llama may be able to output text in other languages than those that meet performance thresholds for safety and helpfulness. We strongly discourage developers from using this model to converse in non-supported languages without implementing finetuning and system controls in alignment with their policies and the best practices shared in the Responsible Use Guide.\nEvaluations\nWe evaluated Llama models for common use cases as well as specific capabilities. Common use cases evaluations measure safety risks of systems for most commonly built applications including chat bot, coding assistant, tool calls. We built dedicated, adversarial evaluation datasets and evaluated systems composed of Llama models and Llama Guard 3 to filter input prompt and output response. It is important to evaluate applications in context, and we recommend building dedicated evaluation dataset for your use case. Prompt Guard and Code Shield are also available if relevant to the application.\nCapability evaluations measure vulnerabilities of Llama models inherent to specific capabilities, for which were crafted dedicated benchmarks including long context, multilingual, tools calls, coding or memorization.\nRed teaming\nFor both scenarios, we conducted recurring red teaming exercises with the goal of discovering risks via adversarial prompting and we used the learnings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets.\nWe partnered early with subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to understand the nature of these real-world harms and how such models may lead to unintended harm for society. Based on these conversations, we derived a set of adversarial goals for the red team to attempt to achieve, such as extracting harmful information or reprogramming the model to act in a potentially harmful capacity.  The red team consisted of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, responsible AI, and integrity in addition to multilingual content specialists with background in integrity issues in specific geographic markets.\nCritical and other risks\nWe specifically focused our efforts on mitigating the following critical risk areas:\n1- CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive materials) helpfulness\nTo assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, we performed uplift testing designed to assess whether use of Llama 3.1 models could meaningfully increase the capabilities of malicious actors to plan or carry out attacks using these types of weapons.\n2. Child Safety\nChild Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development.  For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors including the additional languages Llama 3 is trained on. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\n3. Cyber attack enablement\nOur cyber attack uplift study investigated whether LLMs can enhance human capabilities in hacking tasks, both in terms of skill level and speed.\nOur attack automation study focused on evaluating the capabilities of LLMs when used as autonomous agents in cyber offensive operations, specifically in the context of ransomware attacks. This evaluation was distinct from previous studies that considered LLMs as interactive assistants. The primary objective was to assess whether these models could effectively function as independent agents in executing complex cyber-attacks without human intervention.\nOur study of Llama-3.1-405B’s social engineering uplift for cyber attackers was conducted to assess the effectiveness of AI models in aiding cyber threat actors in spear phishing campaigns. Please read our Llama 3.1 Cyber security whitepaper to learn more.\nCommunity\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership on AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nWe also set up the Llama Impact Grants program to identify and support the most compelling applications of Meta’s Llama model for societal benefit across three categories: education, climate and open innovation. The 20 finalists from the hundreds of applications can be found here.\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nThe core values of Llama 3.1 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3.1 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nBut Llama 3.1 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3.1’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3.1 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. Please refer to available resources including our Responsible Use Guide, Trust and Safety solutions, and other resources to learn more about responsible development.",

Developers can seamlessly combine these two modules. Additionally, the embedding model allows for flexible vector definitions across all dimensions, and both embedding and reranking models support user-defined instructions to enhance performance for specific tasks, languages, or scenarios.\nMultilingual Capability: The Qwen3 Embedding series offer support for over 100 languages, thanks to the multilingual capabilites of Qwen3 models. This includes various programming languages, and provides robust multilingual, cross-lingual, and code retrieval capabilities.\nQwen3-Embedding-8B has the following features:\nModel Type: Text Embedding\nSupported Languages: 100+ Languages\nNumber of Paramaters: 8B\nContext Length: 32k\nEmbedding Dimension: Up to 4096, supports user-defined output dimensions ranging from 32 to 4096\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our blog, GitHub.\nQwen3 Embedding Series Model list\nModel Type\nModels\nSize\nLayers\nSequence Length\nEmbedding Dimension\nMRL Support\nInstruction Aware\nText Embedding\nQwen3-Embedding-0.6B\n0.6B\n28\n32K\n1024\nYes\nYes\nText Embedding\nQwen3-Embedding-4B\n4B\n36\n32K\n2560\nYes\nYes\nText Embedding\nQwen3-Embedding-8B\n8B\n36\n32K\n4096\nYes\nYes\nText Reranking\nQwen3-Reranker-0.6B\n0.6B\n28\n32K\n-\n-\nYes\nText Reranking\nQwen3-Reranker-4B\n4B\n36\n32K\n-\n-\nYes\nText Reranking\nQwen3-Reranker-8B\n8B\n36\n32K\n-\n-\nYes\nNote:\nMRL Support indicates whether the embedding model supports custom dimensions for the final embedding.\nInstruction Aware notes whether the embedding or reranking model supports customizing the input instruction according to different tasks.\nOur evaluation indicates that, for most downstream tasks, using instructions (instruct) typically yields an improvement of 1% to 5% compared to not using them. Therefore, we recommend that developers create tailored instructions specific to their tasks and scenarios. In multilingual contexts, we also advise users to write their instructions in English, as most instructions utilized during the model training process were originally written in English.\nUsage\nWith Transformers versions earlier than 4.51.0, you may encounter the following error:\nKeyError: 'qwen3'\nSentence Transformers Usage\n# Requires transformers>=4.51.0\n# Requires sentence-transformers>=2.7.0\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n# Load the model\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\"Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B\")\n# We recommend enabling flash_attention_2 for better acceleration and memory saving,\n# together with setting `padding_side` to \"left\":\n# model = SentenceTransformer(\n#     \"Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B\",\n#     model_kwargs={\"attn_implementation\": \"flash_attention_2\", \"device_map\": \"auto\"},\n#     tokenizer_kwargs={\"padding_side\": \"left\"},\n# )\n# The queries and documents to embed\nqueries = [\n\"What is the capital of China?\",\n\"Explain gravity\",\n]\ndocuments = [\n\"The capital of China is Beijing.\",\n\"Gravity is a force that attracts two bodies towards each other.

Therefore, we recommend enabling prompt extension. We provide the following two methods for prompt extension:\nUse the Dashscope API for extension.\nApply for a dashscope.api_key in advance (EN | CN).\nConfigure the environment variable DASH_API_KEY to specify the Dashscope API key. For users of Alibaba Cloud's international site, you also need to set the environment variable DASH_API_URL to 'https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/api/v1'. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the dashscope document.\nUse the qwen-plus model for text-to-video tasks and qwen-vl-max for image-to-video tasks.\nYou can modify the model used for extension with the parameter --prompt_extend_model.

It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking.\nA core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a next-token diffusion framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.\nThe model can synthesize speech up to 90 minutes long with up to 4 distinct speakers, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models.\n➡️ Technical Report: VibeVoice Technical Report\n➡️ Project Page: microsoft/VibeVoice\n➡️ Code: microsoft/VibeVoice-Code\nTraining Details\nTransformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with specialized acoustic and semantic tokenizers and a diffusion-based decoding head.\nLLM: Qwen2.5-1.5B for this release.\nTokenizers:\nAcoustic Tokenizer: Based on a σ-VAE variant (proposed in LatentLM), with a mirror-symmetric encoder-decoder structure featuring 7 stages of modified Transformer blocks. Achieves 3200x downsampling from 24kHz input. Encoder/decoder components are ~340M parameters each.\nSemantic Tokenizer: Encoder mirrors the Acoustic Tokenizer's architecture (without VAE components). Trained with an ASR proxy task.\nDiffusion Head: Lightweight module (4 layers, ~123M parameters) conditioned on LLM hidden states. Predicts acoustic VAE features using a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) process. Uses Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and DPM-Solver (and variants) during inference.\nContext Length: Trained with a curriculum increasing up to 65,536 tokens.\nTraining Stages:\nTokenizer Pre-training: Acoustic and Semantic tokenizers are pre-trained separately.\nVibeVoice Training: Pre-trained tokenizers are frozen; only the LLM and diffusion head parameters are trained. A curriculum learning strategy is used for input sequence length (4k -> 16K -> 32K -> 64K). Text tokenizer not explicitly specified, but the LLM (Qwen2.5) typically uses its own. Audio is \"tokenized\" via the acoustic and semantic tokenizers.\nModels\nModel\nContext Length\nGeneration Length\nWeight\nVibeVoice-0.5B-Streaming\n-\n-\nOn the way\nVibeVoice-1.5B\n64K\n~90 min\nYou are here.\nVibeVoice-Large\n32K\n~45 min\nHF link\nInstallation and Usage\nPlease refer to GitHub README\nResponsible Usage\nDirect intended uses\nThe VibeVoice model is limited to research purpose use exploring highly realistic audio dialogue generation detailed in the tech report.\nOut-of-scope uses\nUse in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by MIT License. Use to generate any text transcript. Furthermore, this release is not intended or licensed for any of the following scenarios:\nVoice impersonation without explicit, recorded consent – cloning a real individual’s voice for satire, advertising, ransom, social‑engineering, or authentication bypass.\nDisinformation or impersonation – creating audio presented as genuine recordings of real people or events.\nReal‑time or low‑latency voice conversion – telephone or video‑conference “live deep‑fake” applications.\nUnsupported language – the model is trained only on English and Chinese data; outputs in other languages are unsupported and may be unintelligible or offensive.\nGeneration of background ambience, Foley, or music – VibeVoice is speech‑only and will not produce coherent non‑speech audio.\nRisks and limitations\nWhile efforts have been made to optimize it through various techniques, it may still produce outputs that are unexpected, biased, or inaccurate. VibeVoice inherits any biases, errors, or omissions produced by its base model (specifically, Qwen2.5 1.5b in this release).\nPotential for Deepfakes and Disinformation: High-quality synthetic speech can be misused to create convincing fake audio content for impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users must ensure transcripts are reliable, check content accuracy, and avoid using generated content in misleading ways. Users are expected to use the generated content and to deploy the models in a lawful manner, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions. It is best practice to disclose the use of AI when sharing AI-generated content.\nEnglish and Chinese only: Transcripts in language other than English or Chinese may result in unexpected audio outputs.\nNon-Speech Audio: The model focuses solely on speech synthesis and does not handle background noise, music, or other sound effects.\nOverlapping Speech: The current model does not explicitly model or generate overlapping speech segments in conversations.\nRecommendations\nWe do not recommend using VibeVoice in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development. This model is intended for research and development purposes only. Please use responsibly.\nTo mitigate the risks of misuse, we have:\nEmbedded an audible disclaimer (e.g. “This segment was generated by AI”) automatically into every synthesized audio file.\nAdded an imperceptible watermark to generated audio so third parties can verify VibeVoice provenance. Please see contact information at the end of this model card.\nLogged inference requests (hashed) for abuse pattern detection and publishing aggregated statistics quarterly.\nUsers are responsible for sourcing their datasets legally and ethically. This may include securing appropriate rights and/or anonymizing data prior to use with VibeVoice. Users are reminded to be mindful of data privacy concerns.\nContact\nThis project was conducted by members of Microsoft Research. We welcome feedback and collaboration from our audience. If you have suggestions, questions, or observe unexpected/offensive behavior in our technology, please contact us at VibeVoice@microsoft.com.\nIf the team receives reports of undesired behavior or identifies issues independently, we will update this repository with appropriate mitigations.",

This is the repository for the 7B pretrained model, converted for the Hugging Face Transformers format. Links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom.\nModel Details\nNote: Use of this model is governed by the Meta license. In order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the website and accept our License before requesting access here.\nMeta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.\nModel Developers Meta\nVariations Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes — 7B, 13B, and 70B — as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.\nInput Models input text only.\nOutput Models generate text only.\nModel Architecture Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\nTraining Data\nParams\nContent Length\nGQA\nTokens\nLR\nLlama 2\nA new mix of publicly available online data\n7B\n4k\n✗\n2.0T\n3.0 x 10-4\nLlama 2\nA new mix of publicly available online data\n13B\n4k\n✗\n2.0T\n3.0 x 10-4\nLlama 2\nA new mix of publicly available online data\n70B\n4k\n✔\n2.0T\n1.5 x 10-4\nLlama 2 family of models. Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models -  70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\nModel Dates Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.\nStatus This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\nLicense A custom commercial license is available at: https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/\nResearch Paper \"Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models\"\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\nTo get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the INST and <<SYS>> tags, BOS and EOS tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling strip() on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: chat_completion.\nOut-of-scope Uses Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\nCarbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\nTime (GPU hours)\nPower Consumption (W)\nCarbon Emitted(tCO2eq)\nLlama 2 7B\n184320\n400\n31.22\nLlama 2 13B\n368640\n400\n62.44\nLlama 2 70B\n1720320\n400\n291.42\nTotal\n3311616\n539.00\nCO2 emissions during pretraining. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\nData Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.\nEvaluation Results\nIn this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 models on standard academic benchmarks.For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.\nModel\nSize\nCode\nCommonsense Reasoning\nWorld Knowledge\nReading Comprehension\nMath\nMMLU\nBBH\nAGI Eval\nLlama 1\n7B\n14.1\n60.8\n46.2\n58.5\n6.95\n35.1\n30.3\n23.9\nLlama 1\n13B\n18.9\n66.1\n52.6\n62.3\n10.9\n46.9\n37.0\n33.9\nLlama 1\n33B\n26.0\n70.0\n58.4\n67.6\n21.4\n57.8\n39.8\n41.7\nLlama 1\n65B\n30.7\n70.7\n60.5\n68.6\n30.8\n63.4\n43.5\n47.6\nLlama 2\n7B\n16.8\n63.9\n48.9\n61.3\n14.6\n45.3\n32.6\n29.3\nLlama 2\n13B\n24.5\n66.9\n55.4\n65.8\n28.7\n54.8\n39.4\n39.1\nLlama 2\n70B\n37.5\n71.9\n63.6\n69.4\n35.2\n68.9\n51.2\n54.2\nOverall performance on grouped academic benchmarks.

Same metric definitions as above.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nLlama 2 is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/\nReporting Issues\nPlease report any software “bug,” or other problems with the models through one of the following means:\nReporting issues with the model: github.com/facebookresearch/llama\nReporting problematic content generated by the model: developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback\nReporting bugs and security concerns: facebook.com/whitehat/info\nLlama Model Index\nModel\nLlama2\nLlama2-hf\nLlama2-chat\nLlama2-chat-hf\n7B\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\n13B\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\n70B\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink",

With 2.5 billion parameters and running at 418 RTFx, Canary-Qwen-2.5B supports automatic speech-to-text recognition (ASR) in English with punctuation and capitalization (PnC). The model works in two modes: as a transcription tool (ASR mode) and as an LLM (LLM mode). In ASR mode, the model is only capable of transcribing the speech into text, but does not retain any LLM-specific skills such as reasoning. In LLM mode, the model retains all of the original LLM capabilities, which can be used to post-process the transcript, e.g. summarize it or answer questions about it. In LLM mode, the model does not \"understand\" the raw audio anymore - only its transcript. This model is ready for commercial use.\nLicense/Terms of Use:\nCanary-Qwen-2.5B is released under the CC-BY-4.0 license.

It is built using two base models: nvidia/canary-1b-flash [1,5] and Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B [4], a linear projection, and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) applied to the LLM. The audio encoder computes audio representation that is mapped to the LLM embedding space via a linear projection, and concatenated with the embeddings of text tokens. The model is prompted with \"Transcribe the following: \", using Qwen's chat template.\nLimitations\nInput length. The maximum audio duration in training was 40s, and the maximum token sequence length was 1024 tokens (including prompt, audio, and response). The model may technically be able to process longer sequences, but its accuracy may be degraded.\nExclusively ASR oriented capabilities. The model is not expected to preserve any of the underlying LLM's capabilities into speech modality.\nEnglish-only language support. The model was trained using English data only. It may be able to spuriously transcribe other languages as the underlying encoder was pretrained using German, French, and Spanish speech in addition to English, but it's unlikely to be reliable as a multilingual model.\nNVIDIA NeMo\nTo train, fine-tune or transcribe with Canary-Qwen-2.5B, you will need to install NVIDIA NeMo.\n# Currently requires installing the latest trunk version of NeMo, and PyTorch 2.6+ for FSDP2 support.\npython -m pip install \"nemo_toolkit[asr,tts] @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo.git\"\nHow to Use this Model\nThe model is available for use in the NVIDIA NeMo toolkit [6], and can be used as a pre-trained checkpoint for inference or for fine-tuning on another dataset.\nLoading the Model\nfrom nemo.collections.speechlm2.models import SALM\nmodel = SALM.from_pretrained('nvidia/canary-qwen-2.5b')\nInput:\nInput Type(s): Audio, text prompt\nInput Format(s): Audio: .wav or .flac files.

This upgrade is driven by a series of key technical innovations, mainly including the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, upgraded training data, and high-compression video generation.\n(1) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture\nWan2.2 introduces Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture into the video generation diffusion model. MoE has been widely validated in large language models as an efficient approach to increase total model parameters while keeping inference cost nearly unchanged. In Wan2.2, the A14B model series adopts a two-expert design tailored to the denoising process of diffusion models: a high-noise expert for the early stages, focusing on overall layout; and a low-noise expert for the later stages, refining video details. Each expert model has about 14B parameters, resulting in a total of 27B parameters but only 14B active parameters per step, keeping inference computation and GPU memory nearly unchanged.\nThe transition point between the two experts is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a metric that decreases monotonically as the denoising step $t$ increases. At the beginning of the denoising process, $t$ is large and the noise level is high, so the SNR is at its minimum, denoted as ${SNR}{min}$. In this stage, the high-noise expert is activated. We define a threshold step ${t}{moe}$ corresponding to half of the ${SNR}{min}$, and switch to the low-noise expert when $t<{t}{moe}$.\nTo validate the effectiveness of the MoE architecture, four settings are compared based on their validation loss curves. The baseline Wan2.1 model does not employ the MoE architecture. Among the MoE-based variants, the Wan2.1 & High-Noise Expert reuses the Wan2.1 model as the low-noise expert while uses the  Wan2.2's high-noise expert, while the Wan2.1 & Low-Noise Expert uses Wan2.1 as the high-noise expert and employ the Wan2.2's low-noise expert. The Wan2.2 (MoE) (our final version) achieves the lowest validation loss, indicating that its generated video distribution is closest to ground-truth and exhibits superior convergence.\n(2) Efficient High-Definition Hybrid TI2V\nTo enable more efficient deployment, Wan2.2 also explores a high-compression design. In addition to the 27B MoE models, a 5B dense model, i.e., TI2V-5B, is released. It is supported by a high-compression Wan2.2-VAE, which achieves a $T\\times H\\times W$ compression ratio of $4\\times16\\times16$, increasing the overall compression rate to 64 while maintaining high-quality video reconstruction. With an additional patchification layer, the total compression ratio of TI2V-5B reaches $4\\times32\\times32$. Without specific optimization, TI2V-5B can generate a 5-second 720P video in under 9 minutes on a single consumer-grade GPU, ranking among the fastest 720P@24fps video generation models. This model also natively supports both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks within a single unified framework, covering both academic research and practical applications.\nComparisons to SOTAs\nWe compared Wan2.2 with leading closed-source commercial models on our new Wan-Bench 2.0, evaluating performance across multiple crucial dimensions. The results demonstrate that Wan2.2 achieves superior performance compared to these leading models.\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, please cite us.\n@article{wan2025,\ntitle={Wan: Open and Advanced Large-Scale Video Generative Models},\nauthor={Team Wan and Ang Wang and Baole Ai and Bin Wen and Chaojie Mao and Chen-Wei Xie and Di Chen and Feiwu Yu and Haiming Zhao and Jianxiao Yang and Jianyuan Zeng and Jiayu Wang and Jingfeng Zhang and Jingren Zhou and Jinkai Wang and Jixuan Chen and Kai Zhu and Kang Zhao and Keyu Yan and Lianghua Huang and Mengyang Feng and Ningyi Zhang and Pandeng Li and Pingyu Wu and Ruihang Chu and Ruili Feng and Shiwei Zhang and Siyang Sun and Tao Fang and Tianxing Wang and Tianyi Gui and Tingyu Weng and Tong Shen and Wei Lin and Wei Wang and Wei Wang and Wenmeng Zhou and Wente Wang and Wenting Shen and Wenyuan Yu and Xianzhong Shi and Xiaoming Huang and Xin Xu and Yan Kou and Yangyu Lv and Yifei Li and Yijing Liu and Yiming Wang and Yingya Zhang and Yitong Huang and Yong Li and You Wu and Yu Liu and Yulin Pan and Yun Zheng and Yuntao Hong and Yupeng Shi and Yutong Feng and Zeyinzi Jiang and Zhen Han and Zhi-Fan Wu and Ziyu Liu},\njournal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.20314},\nyear={2025}\n}\nLicense Agreement\nThe models in this repository are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

The base model was trained on a dataset of 8 trillion tokens, comprising 6.5 trillion tokens of general pretraining data followed by 1.5 trillion tokens of midtraining data with enhanced focus on mathematical reasoning and code generation. Following pretraining, the model underwent supervised fine-tuning on high-quality instruction datasets. The instruction-tuned model was further refined through reinforcement learning on verifiable rewards as well as for human preference. We use a modified version of TorchTitan for pretraining, Axolotl for supervised fine-tuning, and a modified version of Verifiers for reinforcement learning.\nThe development of AFM-4.5B prioritized data quality as a fundamental requirement for achieving robust model performance. We collaborated with DatologyAI, a company specializing in large-scale data curation. DatologyAI's curation pipeline integrates a suite of proprietary algorithms—model-based quality filtering, embedding-based curation, target distribution-matching, source mixing, and synthetic data. Their expertise enabled the creation of a curated dataset tailored to support strong real-world performance.\nThe model architecture follows a standard transformer decoder-only design based on Vaswani et al., incorporating several key modifications for enhanced performance and efficiency. Notable architectural features include grouped query attention for improved inference efficiency and ReLU^2 activation functions instead of SwiGLU to enable sparsification while maintaining or exceeding performance benchmarks.\nThe model available in this repo is the base model following merging and context extension.\nModel Details\nModel Architecture: ArceeForCausalLM\nParameters: 4.5B\nTraining Tokens: 8T\nLicense: Apache-2.0\nBenchmarks\nHow to use with transformers\nYou can use the model directly with the transformers library.\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"arcee-ai/AFM-4.5B-Base\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id,\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\nprompt = \"Once upon a time \"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(model.device)\n# Generate text\noutputs = model.generate(\ninput_ids,\nmax_new_tokens=100,\ndo_sample=True,\ntemperature=0.7,\ntop_p=0.95\n)\ngenerated_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\nprint(generated_text)\nLicense\nAFM-4.5B is released under the Apache-2.0 license.",

However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\nAdequate Output Length: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 81,920 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\nStandardize Output Format: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\nMath Problems: Include \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" in the prompt.\nMultiple-Choice Questions: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: \"Please show your choice in the answer field with only the choice letter, e.g., \"answer\": \"C\".\"\nNo Thinking Content in History: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\ntitle={Qwen3 Technical Report},\nauthor={Qwen Team},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2505.09388},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.CL},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388},\n}",

The model is built on Qwen3-8B and SigLIP2-400M with a total of 8B parameters. It exhibits a significant performance improvement over previous MiniCPM-V and MiniCPM-o models, and introduces new useful features. Notable features of MiniCPM-V 4.5 include:\n🔥 State-of-the-art Vision-Language Capability.\nMiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves an average score of 77.0 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular benchmarks. With only 8B parameters, it surpasses widely used proprietary models like GPT-4o-latest, Gemini-2.0 Pro, and strong open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL 72B for vision-language capabilities, making it the most performant MLLM under 30B parameters.\n🎬 Efficient High-FPS and Long Video Understanding. Powered by a new unified 3D-Resampler over images and videos, MiniCPM-V 4.5 can now achieve 96x compression rate for video tokens, where 6 448x448 video frames can be jointly compressed into 64 video tokens (normally 1,536 tokens for most MLLMs). This means that the model can perceive significantly more video frames without increasing the LLM inference cost. This brings state-of-the-art high-FPS (up to 10FPS) video understanding and long video understanding capabilities on Video-MME, LVBench, MLVU, MotionBench, FavorBench, etc., efficiently.\n⚙️ Controllable Hybrid Fast/Deep Thinking. MiniCPM-V 4.5 supports both fast thinking for efficient frequent usage with competitive performance, and deep thinking for more complex problem solving. To cover efficiency and performance trade-offs in different user scenarios, this fast/deep thinking mode can be switched in a highly controlled fashion.\n💪 Strong OCR, Document Parsing and Others.\nBased on LLaVA-UHD architecture, MiniCPM-V 4.5 can process high-resolution images with any aspect ratio and up to 1.8 million pixels (e.g., 1344x1344), using 4x less visual tokens than most MLLMs. The model achieves leading performance on OCRBench, surpassing proprietary models such as GPT-4o-latest and Gemini 2.5. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance for PDF document parsing capability on OmniDocBench among general MLLMs. Based on the latest RLAIF-V and VisCPM techniques, it features trustworthy behaviors, outperforming GPT-4o-latest on MMHal-Bench, and supports multilingual capabilities in more than 30 languages.\n💫 Easy Usage.\nMiniCPM-V 4.5 can be easily used in various ways: (1) llama.cpp and ollama support for efficient CPU inference on local devices, (2) int4, GGUF and AWQ format quantized models in 16 sizes, (3) SGLang and vLLM support for high-throughput and memory-efficient inference, (4) fine-tuning on new domains and tasks with Transformers and LLaMA-Factory, (5) quick local WebUI demo, (6) optimized local iOS app on iPhone and iPad, and (7) online web demo on server. See our Cookbook for full usages!\nKey Techniques\nArchitechture: Unified 3D-Resampler for High-density Video Compression. MiniCPM-V 4.5 introduces a 3D-Resampler that overcomes the performance-efficiency trade-off in video understanding. By grouping and jointly compressing up to 6 consecutive video frames into just 64 tokens (the same token count used for a single image in MiniCPM-V series), MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves a 96× compression rate for video tokens. This allows the model to process more video frames without additional LLM computational cost, enabling high-FPS video and long video understanding. The architecture supports unified encoding for images, multi-image inputs, and videos, ensuring seamless capability and knowledge transfer.\nPre-training: Unified Learning for OCR and Knowledge from Documents. Existing MLLMs learn OCR capability and knowledge from documents in isolated training approaches. We observe that the essential difference between these two training approaches is the visibility of the text in images. By dynamically corrupting text regions in documents with varying noise levels and asking the model to reconstruct the text, the model learns to adaptively and properly switch between accurate text recognition (when text is visible) and multimodal context-based knowledge reasoning (when text is heavily obscured). This eliminates reliance on error-prone document parsers in knowledge learning from documents, and prevents hallucinations from over-augmented OCR data, resulting in top-tier OCR and multimodal knowledge performance with minimal engineering overhead.\nPost-training: Hybrid Fast/Deep Thinking with Multimodal RL. MiniCPM-V 4.5 offers a balanced reasoning experience through two switchable modes: fast thinking for efficient daily use and deep thinking for complex tasks. Using a new hybrid reinforcement learning method, the model jointly optimizes both modes, significantly enhancing fast-mode performance without compromising deep-mode capability. Incorporated with RLPR and RLAIF-V, it generalizes robust reasoning skills from broad multimodal data while effectively reducing hallucinations.\nEvaluation\nInference Efficiency\nOpenCompass\nModel\nSize\nAvg Score ↑\nTotal Inference Time ↓\nGLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking\n10.3B\n76.6\n17.5h\nMiMo-VL-7B-RL\n8.3B\n76.4\n11h\nMiniCPM-V 4.5\n8.7B\n77.0\n7.5h\nVideo-MME\nModel\nSize\nAvg Score ↑\nTotal Inference Time ↓\nGPU Mem ↓\nQwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct\n8.3B\n71.6\n3h\n60G\nGLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking\n10.3B\n73.6\n2.63h\n32G\nMiniCPM-V 4.5\n8.7B\n73.5\n0.26h\n28G\nBoth Video-MME and OpenCompass were evaluated using 8×A100 GPUs for inference.

on the implementation.\nIt is recommended to adopt a dedicated inference framework, e.g., SGLang and vLLM, for inference tasks.\nDepending on the inference settings, you may observe better efficiency with flash-linear-attention and causal-conv1d.\nSee the links for detailed instructions and requirements.\nDeployment\nFor deployment, you can use the latest sglang or vllm to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.\nSGLang\nSGLang is a fast serving framework for large language models and vision language models.\nSGLang could be used to launch a server with OpenAI-compatible API service.\nsglang>=0.5.2 is required for Qwen3-Next, which can be installed using:\npip install 'sglang[all]>=0.5.2'\nSee its documentation for more details.\nThe following command can be used to create an API endpoint at http://localhost:30000/v1 with maximum context length 256K tokens using tensor parallel on 4 GPUs.\npython -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct --port 30000 --tp-size 4 --context-length 262144 --mem-fraction-static 0.8\nThe following command is recommended for MTP with the rest settings the same as above:\npython -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct --port 30000 --tp-size 4 --context-length 262144 --mem-fraction-static 0.8 --speculative-algo NEXTN --speculative-num-steps 3 --speculative-eagle-topk 1 --speculative-num-draft-tokens 4\nThe default context length is 256K. Consider reducing the context length to a smaller value, e.g., 32768, if the server fails to start.\nPlease also refer to SGLang's usage guide on Qwen3-Next.\nvLLM\nvLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs.\nvLLM could be used to launch a server with OpenAI-compatible API service.\nvllm>=0.10.2 is required for Qwen3-Next, which can be installed using:\npip install 'vllm>=0.10.2'\nSee its documentation for more details.\nThe following command can be used to create an API endpoint at http://localhost:8000/v1 with maximum context length 256K tokens using tensor parallel on 4 GPUs.\nvllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct --port 8000 --tensor-parallel-size 4 --max-model-len 262144\nThe following command is recommended for MTP with the rest settings the same as above:\nvllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct --port 8000 --tensor-parallel-size 4 --max-model-len 262144 --speculative-config '{\"method\":\"qwen3_next_mtp\",\"num_speculative_tokens\":2}'\nThe default context length is 256K. Consider reducing the context length to a smaller value, e.g., 32768, if the server fails to start.\nPlease also refer to vLLM's usage guide on Qwen3-Next.\nAgentic Use\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using Qwen-Agent to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n# Define LLM\nllm_cfg = {\n'model': 'Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct',\n# Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:\n'model_server': 'http://localhost:8000/v1',  # api_base\n'api_key': 'EMPTY',\n}\n# Define Tools\ntools = [\n{'mcpServers': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file\n'time': {\n'command': 'uvx',\n'args': ['mcp-server-time', '--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai']\n},\n\"fetch\": {\n\"command\": \"uvx\",\n\"args\": [\"mcp-server-fetch\"]\n}\n}\n},\n'code_interpreter',  # Built-in tools\n]\n# Define Agent\nbot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)\n# Streaming generation\nmessages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen'}]\nfor responses in bot.run(messages=messages):\npass\nprint(responses)\nProcessing Ultra-Long Texts\nQwen3-Next natively supports context lengths of up to 262,144 tokens.\nFor conversations where the total length (including both input and output) significantly exceeds this limit, we recommend using RoPE scaling techniques to handle long texts effectively.\nWe have validated the model's performance on context lengths of up to 1 million tokens using the YaRN method.\nYaRN is currently supported by several inference frameworks, e.g., transformers, vllm and sglang.\nIn general, there are two approaches to enabling YaRN for supported frameworks:\nModifying the model files:\nIn the config.json file, add the rope_scaling fields:\n{\n...,\n\"rope_scaling\": {\n\"rope_type\": \"yarn\",\n\"factor\": 4.0,\n\"original_max_position_embeddings\": 262144\n}\n}\nPassing command line arguments:\nFor vllm, you can use\nVLLM_ALLOW_LONG_MAX_MODEL_LEN=1 vllm serve ... --rope-scaling '{\"rope_type\":\"yarn\",\"factor\":4.0,\"original_max_position_embeddings\":262144}' --max-model-len 1010000\nFor sglang, you can use\nSGLANG_ALLOW_OVERWRITE_LONGER_CONTEXT_LEN=1 python -m sglang.launch_server ... --json-model-override-args '{\"rope_scaling\":{\"rope_type\":\"yarn\",\"factor\":4.0,\"original_max_position_embeddings\":262144}}' --context-length 1010000\nAll the notable open-source frameworks implement static YaRN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, potentially impacting performance on shorter texts.\nWe advise adding the rope_scaling configuration only when processing long contexts is required.\nIt is also recommended to modify the factor as needed. For example, if the typical context length for your application is 524,288 tokens, it would be better to set factor as 2.0.\nLong-Context Performance\nWe test the model on an 1M version of the RULER benchmark.\nModel Name\nAcc avg\n4k\n8k\n16k\n32k\n64k\n96k\n128k\n192k\n256k\n384k\n512k\n640k\n768k\n896k\n1000k\nQwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507\n86.8\n98.0\n96.7\n96.9\n97.2\n93.4\n91.0\n89.1\n89.8\n82.5\n83.6\n78.4\n79.7\n77.6\n75.7\n72.8\nQwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507\n92.5\n98.5\n97.6\n96.9\n97.3\n95.8\n94.9\n93.9\n94.5\n91.0\n92.2\n90.9\n87.8\n84.8\n86.5\n84.5\nQwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct\n91.8\n98.5\n99.0\n98.0\n98.7\n97.6\n95.0\n96.0\n94.0\n93.5\n91.7\n86.9\n85.5\n81.7\n80.3\n80.3\nQwen3-Next are evaluated with YaRN enabled. Qwen3-2507 models are evaluated with Dual Chunk Attention enabled.\nSince the evaluation is time-consuming, we use 260 samples for each length (13 sub-tasks, 20 samples for each).\nBest Practices\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\nSampling Parameters:\nWe suggest using Temperature=0.7, TopP=0.8, TopK=20, and MinP=0.\nFor supported frameworks, you can adjust the presence_penalty parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\nAdequate Output Length: We recommend using an output length of 16,384 tokens for most queries, which is adequate for instruct models.\nStandardize Output Format: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\nMath Problems: Include \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" in the prompt.\nMultiple-Choice Questions: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: \"Please show your choice in the answer field with only the choice letter, e.g., \"answer\": \"C\".\"\nCitation\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\ntitle={Qwen3 Technical Report},\nauthor={Qwen Team},\nyear={2025},\neprint={2505.09388},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.CL},\nurl={https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388},\n}\n@article{qwen2.5-1m,\ntitle={Qwen2.5-1M Technical Report},\nauthor={An Yang and Bowen Yu and Chengyuan Li and Dayiheng Liu and Fei Huang and Haoyan Huang and Jiandong Jiang and Jianhong Tu and Jianwei Zhang and Jingren Zhou and Junyang Lin and Kai Dang and Kexin Yang and Le Yu and Mei Li and Minmin Sun and Qin Zhu and Rui Men and Tao He and Weijia Xu and Wenbiao Yin and Wenyuan Yu and Xiafei Qiu and Xingzhang Ren and Xinlong Yang and Yong Li and Zhiying Xu and Zipeng Zhang},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2501.15383},\nyear={2025}\n}",

The following list of potential uses is\nnot comprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development.\nContent Creation and Communication\nText Generation: These models can be used to generate creative text\nformats such as poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.\nChatbots and Conversational AI: Power conversational interfaces\nfor customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.\nText Summarization: Generate concise summaries of a text corpus,\nresearch papers, or reports.\nImage Data Extraction: These models can be used to extract,\ninterpret, and summarize visual data for text communications.\nResearch and Education\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and VLM Research: These\nmodels can serve as a foundation for researchers to experiment with VLM\nand NLP techniques, develop algorithms, and contribute to the\nadvancement of the field.\nLanguage Learning Tools: Support interactive language learning\nexperiences, aiding in grammar correction or providing writing practice.\nKnowledge Exploration: Assist researchers in exploring large\nbodies of text by generating summaries or answering questions about\nspecific topics.\nLimitations\nTraining Data\nThe quality and diversity of the training data significantly\ninfluence the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data\ncan lead to limitations in the model's responses.\nThe scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas\nthe model can handle effectively.\nContext and Task Complexity\nModels are better at tasks that can be framed with clear\nprompts and instructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be\nchallenging.\nA model's performance can be influenced by the amount of context\nprovided (longer context generally leads to better outputs, up to a\ncertain point).\nLanguage Ambiguity and Nuance\nNatural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle\nto grasp subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\nFactual Accuracy\nModels generate responses based on information they learned\nfrom their training datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They\nmay generate incorrect or outdated factual statements.\nCommon Sense\nModels rely on statistical patterns in language. They might\nlack the ability to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.\nEthical Considerations and Risks\nThe development of vision-language models (VLMs) raises several ethical\nconcerns. In creating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:\nBias and Fairness\nVLMs trained on large-scale, real-world text and image data can\nreflect socio-cultural biases embedded in the training material. These\nmodels underwent careful scrutiny, input data pre-processing described\nand posterior evaluations reported in this card.\nMisinformation and Misuse\nVLMs can be misused to generate text that is false, misleading,\nor harmful.\nGuidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the\n[Responsible Generative AI Toolkit][rai-toolkit].\nTransparency and Accountability:\nThis model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,\ncapabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.\nA responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to\nshare innovation by making VLM technology accessible to developers and\nresearchers across the AI ecosystem.\nRisks identified and mitigations:\nPerpetuation of biases: It's encouraged to perform continuous\nmonitoring (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of\nde-biasing techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use\ncases.\nGeneration of harmful content: Mechanisms and guidelines for content\nsafety are essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and\nimplement appropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific\nproduct policies and application use cases.\nMisuse for malicious purposes: Technical limitations and developer\nand end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of\nVLMs. Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag\nmisuse are provided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the\n[Gemma Prohibited Use Policy][prohibited-use].\nPrivacy violations: Models were trained on data filtered for removal\nof certain personal information and other sensitive data. Developers are\nencouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving\ntechniques.",
