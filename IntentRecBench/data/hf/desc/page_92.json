    "HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct": "SmolVLM\nModel Summary\nResources\nUses\nTechnical Summary\nHow to get started\nModel optimizations\nMisuse and Out-of-scope Use\nLicense\nTraining Details\nTraining Data\nEvaluation\nCitation information\nSmolVLM\nSmolVLM is a compact open multimodal model that accepts arbitrary sequences of image and text inputs to produce text outputs. Designed for efficiency, SmolVLM can answer questions about images, describe visual content, create stories grounded on multiple images, or function as a pure language model without visual inputs. Its lightweight architecture makes it suitable for on-device applications while maintaining strong performance on multimodal tasks.\nModel Summary\nDeveloped by: Hugging Face 🤗\nModel type: Multi-modal model (image+text)\nLanguage(s) (NLP): English\nLicense: Apache 2.0\nArchitecture: Based on Idefics3 (see technical summary)\nResources\nDemo: SmolVLM Demo\nBlog: Blog post\nUses\nSmolVLM can be used for inference on multimodal (image + text) tasks where the input comprises text queries along with one or more images. Text and images can be interleaved arbitrarily, enabling tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and storytelling based on visual content. The model does not support image generation.\nTo fine-tune SmolVLM on a specific task, you can follow the fine-tuning tutorial.\nTechnical Summary\nSmolVLM leverages the lightweight SmolLM2 language model to provide a compact yet powerful multimodal experience. It introduces several changes compared to previous Idefics models:\nImage compression: We introduce a more radical image compression compared to Idefics3 to enable the model to infer faster and use less RAM.\nVisual Token Encoding: SmolVLM uses 81 visual tokens to encode image patches of size 384×384. Larger images are divided into patches, each encoded separately, enhancing efficiency without compromising performance.\nMore details about the training and architecture are available in our technical report.\nHow to get started\nYou can use transformers to load, infer and fine-tune SmolVLM.\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForVision2Seq\nfrom transformers.image_utils import load_image\nDEVICE = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\n# Load images\nimage1 = load_image(\"https://cdn.britannica.com/61/93061-050-99147DCE/Statue-of-Liberty-Island-New-York-Bay.jpg\")\nimage2 = load_image(\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/merve/chameleon-7b/resolve/main/bee.jpg\")\n# Initialize processor and model\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct\")\nmodel = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(\n\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct\",\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n_attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\" if DEVICE == \"cuda\" else \"eager\",\n).to(DEVICE)\n# Create input messages\nmessages = [\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\"type\": \"image\"},\n{\"type\": \"image\"},\n{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Can you describe the two images?\"}\n]\n},\n]\n# Prepare inputs\nprompt = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True)\ninputs = processor(text=prompt, images=[image1, image2], return_tensors=\"pt\")\ninputs = inputs.to(DEVICE)\n# Generate outputs\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=500)\ngenerated_texts = processor.batch_decode(\ngenerated_ids,\nskip_special_tokens=True,\n)\nprint(generated_texts[0])\n\"\"\"\nAssistant: The first image shows a green statue of the Statue of Liberty standing on a stone pedestal in front of a body of water.\nThe statue is holding a torch in its right hand and a tablet in its left hand. The water is calm and there are no boats or other objects visible.\nThe sky is clear and there are no clouds. The second image shows a bee on a pink flower.\nThe bee is black and yellow and is collecting pollen from the flower. The flower is surrounded by green leaves.\n\"\"\"\nModel optimizations\nPrecision: For better performance, load and run the model in half-precision (torch.float16 or torch.bfloat16) if your hardware supports it.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForVision2Seq\nimport torch\nmodel = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(\n\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct\",\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16\n).to(\"cuda\")\nYou can also load SmolVLM with 4/8-bit quantization using bitsandbytes, torchao or Quanto. Refer to this page for other options.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForVision2Seq, BitsAndBytesConfig\nimport torch\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)\nmodel = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(\n\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct\",\nquantization_config=quantization_config,\n)\nVision Encoder Efficiency: Adjust the image resolution by setting size={\"longest_edge\": N*384} when initializing the processor, where N is your desired value. The default N=4 works well, which results in input images of\nsize 1536×1536. For documents, N=5 might be beneficial. Decreasing N can save GPU memory and is appropriate for lower-resolution images. This is also useful if you want to fine-tune on videos.\nMisuse and Out-of-scope Use\nSmolVLM is not intended for high-stakes scenarios or critical decision-making processes that affect an individual's well-being or livelihood. The model may produce content that appears factual but may not be accurate. Misuse includes, but is not limited to:\nProhibited Uses:\nEvaluating or scoring individuals (e.g., in employment, education, credit)\nCritical automated decision-making\nGenerating unreliable factual content\nMalicious Activities:\nSpam generation\nDisinformation campaigns\nHarassment or abuse\nUnauthorized surveillance\nLicense\nSmolVLM is built upon the shape-optimized SigLIP as image encoder and SmolLM2 for text decoder part.\nWe release the SmolVLM checkpoints under the Apache 2.0 license.\nTraining Details\nTraining Data\nThe training data comes from The Cauldron and Docmatix datasets, with emphasis on document understanding (25%) and image captioning (18%), while maintaining balanced coverage across other crucial capabilities like visual reasoning, chart comprehension, and general instruction following.\nEvaluation\nModel\nMMMU (val)\nMathVista (testmini)\nMMStar (val)\nDocVQA (test)\nTextVQA (val)\nMin GPU RAM required (GB)\nSmolVLM\n38.8\n44.6\n42.1\n81.6\n72.7\n5.02\nQwen-VL 2B\n41.1\n47.8\n47.5\n90.1\n79.7\n13.70\nInternVL2 2B\n34.3\n46.3\n49.8\n86.9\n73.4\n10.52\nPaliGemma 3B 448px\n34.9\n28.7\n48.3\n32.2\n56.0\n6.72\nmoondream2\n32.4\n24.3\n40.3\n70.5\n65.2\n3.87\nMiniCPM-V-2\n38.2\n39.8\n39.1\n71.9\n74.1\n7.88\nMM1.5 1B\n35.8\n37.2\n0.0\n81.0\n72.5\nNaN\nCitation information\nYou can cite us in the following way:\n@article{marafioti2025smolvlm,\ntitle={SmolVLM: Redefining small and efficient multimodal models},\nauthor={Andrés Marafioti and Orr Zohar and Miquel Farré and Merve Noyan and Elie Bakouch and Pedro Cuenca and Cyril Zakka and Loubna Ben Allal and Anton Lozhkov and Nouamane Tazi and Vaibhav Srivastav and Joshua Lochner and Hugo Larcher and Mathieu Morlon and Lewis Tunstall and Leandro von Werra and Thomas Wolf},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.05299},\nyear={2025}\n}",

The image encoder is initialized from\nSigLIP-So400m/14.\nSimilar to the original PaliGemma model, PaliGemma 2 is trained following the\nPaLI-3 recipes.\nInputs and outputs\nInput: Image and text string, such as a prompt to caption the image, or\na question.\nOutput: Generated text in response to the input, such as a caption of\nthe image, an answer to a question, a list of object bounding box\ncoordinates, or segmentation codewords.\nCitation\n@article{\ntitle={PaliGemma 2: A Family of Versatile VLMs for Transfer},\nauthor={Andreas Steiner and André Susano Pinto and Michael Tschannen and Daniel Keysers and Xiao Wang and Yonatan Bitton and Alexey Gritsenko and Matthias Minderer and Anthony Sherbondy and Shangbang Long and Siyang Qin and Reeve Ingle and Emanuele Bugliarello and Sahar Kazemzadeh and Thomas Mesnard and Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin and Lucas Beyer and Xiaohua Zhai},\nyear={2024},\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2412.03555}\n}\nModel data\nPre-train datasets\nPaliGemma 2 is pre-trained on the following mixture of datasets:\nWebLI: WebLI (Web Language Image) is\na web-scale multilingual image-text dataset built from the public web. A\nwide range of WebLI splits are used to acquire versatile model capabilities,\nsuch as visual semantic understanding, object localization,\nvisually-situated text understanding, and multilinguality.\nCC3M-35L: Curated English image-alt_text pairs from webpages\n(Sharma et al., 2018). We used the\nGoogle Cloud Translation API to\ntranslate into 34 additional languages.\nVQ²A-CC3M-35L/VQG-CC3M-35L: A subset of VQ2A-CC3M\n(Changpinyo et al., 2022a),\ntranslated into the same additional 34 languages as CC3M-35L, using the\nGoogle Cloud Translation API.\nOpenImages: Detection and object-aware questions and answers\n(Piergiovanni et al. 2022) generated by\nhandcrafted rules on the OpenImages dataset.\nWIT: Images and texts collected from Wikipedia\n(Srinivasan et al., 2021).\nPaliGemma 2 is based on Gemma 2, and you can find information on the\npre-training datasets for Gemma 2 in the\nGemma 2 model card.\nData responsibility filtering\nThe following filters are applied to WebLI, with the goal of training PaliGemma\n2 on safe and responsible data:\nPornographic image filtering: This filter removes images deemed to be of\npornographic nature.\nText safety filtering: We identify and filter out images that are paired\nwith unsafe text. Unsafe text is any text deemed to contain or be about\nchild sexual abuse imagery (CSAI), pornography, vulgarities, or is otherwise\noffensive.\nText toxicity filtering: We further use the Perspective\nAPI to identify and filter out images that are\npaired with text deemed insulting, obscene, hateful or otherwise toxic.\nText personal information filtering: We filtered certain personal\ninformation and other sensitive data using the Cloud Data Loss Prevention\n(DLP) API to protect the\nprivacy of individuals. Identifiers such as social security numbers and\nother sensitive information types were removed.\nAdditional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in\nline with our policies and practices.\nUse in Transformers\nThe following snippets use model google/paligemma2-10b-ft-docci-448 for reference purposes.\nThe model in this repo you are now browsing may have been trained for other tasks, please\nmake sure you use appropriate inputs for the task at hand.\nfrom transformers import (\nPaliGemmaProcessor,\nPaliGemmaForConditionalGeneration,\n)\nfrom transformers.image_utils import load_image\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"google/paligemma2-3b-ft-docci-448\"\nurl = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/tasks/car.jpg\"\nimage = load_image(url)\nmodel = PaliGemmaForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\"auto\").eval()\nprocessor = PaliGemmaProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\n# Instruct the model to create a caption in English\nprompt = \"caption en\"\nmodel_inputs = processor(text=prompt, images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(torch.bfloat16).to(model.device)\ninput_len = model_inputs[\"input_ids\"].shape[-1]\nwith torch.inference_mode():\ngeneration = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=False)\ngeneration = generation[0][input_len:]\ndecoded = processor.decode(generation, skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(decoded)\nImplementation information\nHardware\nPaliGemma 2 was trained using the latest generation of Tensor Processing Unit\n(TPU) hardware (TPUv5e).\nSoftware\nTraining was completed using JAX,\nFlax,\nTFDS and\nbig_vision.\nJAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,\nincluding TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models.\nTFDS is used to access datasets and Flax is used for model architecture.

The following list of potential uses is not\ncomprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the\nGemma Prohibited Use Policy.\nFine-tune on specific vision-language task:\nThe pre-trained models can be fine-tuned on a wide range of vision-language\ntasks such as: image captioning, short video caption, visual question\nanswering, text reading, object detection and object segmentation.\nThe pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific domains such as remote\nsensing question answering, visual questions from people who are blind,\nscience question answering, describe UI element functionalities.\nThe pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for tasks with non-textual outputs\nsuch as bounding boxes or segmentation masks.\nVision-language research:\nThe pre-trained models and fine-tuned models can serve as a foundation for\nresearchers to experiment with VLM techniques, develop algorithms, and\ncontribute to the advancement of the field.\nEthical considerations and risks\nThe development of vision-language models (VLMs) raises several ethical\nconcerns. In creating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:\nBias and Fairness\nVLMs trained on large-scale, real-world image-text data can reflect\nsocio-cultural biases embedded in the training material. These models\nunderwent careful scrutiny, input data pre-processing described and\nposterior evaluations reported in this card.\nMisinformation and Misuse\nVLMs can be misused to generate text that is false, misleading, or\nharmful.\nGuidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the\nResponsible Generative AI Toolkit.\nTransparency and Accountability\nThis model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,\ncapabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.\nA responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to share\ninnovation by making VLM technology accessible to developers and\nresearchers across the AI ecosystem.\nRisks identified and mitigations:\nPerpetuation of biases: It's encouraged to perform continuous monitoring\n(using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of de-biasing\ntechniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use cases.\nGeneration of harmful content: Mechanisms and guidelines for content\nsafety are essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and\nimplement appropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific\nproduct policies and application use cases.\nMisuse for malicious purposes: Technical limitations and developer and\nend-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of LLMs.\nEducational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag misuse are\nprovided: see the Responsible Generative AI Toolkit.\nProhibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the\nGemma Prohibited Use Policy.\nPrivacy violations: Models were trained on data filtered to remove\ncertain personal information and sensitive data. Developers are encouraged\nto adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving techniques.\nLimitations\nMost limitations inherited from the underlying Gemma 2 models still apply:\nVLMs are better at tasks that can be framed with clear prompts and\ninstructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be challenging.\nNatural language is inherently complex. VLMs might struggle to grasp\nsubtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\nVLMs generate responses based on information they learned from their\ntraining datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They may generate\nincorrect or outdated factual statements.\nVLMs rely on statistical patterns in language and images. They might\nlack the ability to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.\nPaliGemma 2 was designed first and foremost to serve as a general\npre-trained model for fine-tuning to specialized tasks. Hence, its \"out of\nthe box\" or \"zero-shot\" performance might lag behind models designed\nspecifically for general purpose use.\nPaliGemma 2 is not a multi-turn chatbot. It is designed for a single round\nof image and text input.",

For other tasks, we employ the LLM-as-a-Judge framework,\nwhich uses a pre-trained large language model to evaluate task performance by generating and scoring responses based on relevance, coherence, and accuracy criteria.\nRefer to the AudioBench paper for more details.\nTask\nDataset\nMERaLiON\nQwen2-Audio 7B\nWavLLM\nSALMONN-7B\nCascaded Model\nAutomatic Speech RecognitionWER (↓)\nLibriSpeech-Test-Clean\n0.03\n0.03\n0.02\n0.10\n0.03\nLibriSpeech-Test-Other\n0.05\n0.06\n0.05\n0.10\n0.05\nCommon-Voice-15-En-Test\n0.10\n0.11\n0.15\n0.31\n0.11\nEarnings21-Test\n0.17\n0.19\n0.65\n0.26\n0.11\nEarnings22-Test\n0.20\n0.24\n0.67\n0.36\n0.14\nMNSC-ASR-Part 1\n0.05\n0.07\n-\n0.09\n0.07\nMNSC-ASR-Part 2\n0.05\n0.19\n-\n0.42\n0.33\nMNSC-ASR-Part 3\n0.28\n0.35\n-\n0.66\n0.30\nMNSC-ASR-Part 4\n0.40\n0.56\n-\n0.76\n0.48\nMNSC-ASR-Part 5\n0.21\n0.28\n-\n0.35\n0.23\nMNSC-ASR-Part 6\n0.15\n0.22\n-\n0.25\n0.18\nSpeech TranslationBLEU (↑)\nCoVoST 2 En → Id\n32.62\n16.33\n13.84\n14.14\n27.62\nCoVoST 2 En → Zh\n37.98\n25.77\n31.96\n33.89\n35.27\nCoVoST 2 En → Ta\n8.50\n0.03\n0.00\n0.00\n8.46\nCoVoST 2 Id → En\n37.07\n6.33\n5.93\n26.89\n46.80\nCoVoST 2 Zh → En\n15.01\n16.47\n2.37\n5.30\n15.21\nCoVoST 2 Ta → En\n3.97\n0.04\n0.17\n0.36\n2.83\nSpoken Question AnsweringLLM-as-a-Judge (↑)\nSLUE-SQA-5\n82.94\n80.05\n83.92\n83.48\n88.58\nSpoken-SQuAD\n70.33\n64.86\n77.65\n66.40\n88.62\nCN-College-Listen-Test\n85.03\n74.51\n65.43\n50.90\n91.85\nSingapore-Public-Speech-SQA\n60.32\n58.31\n58.55\n59.24\n73.11\nMNSC-SQA-Part 3\n51.4\n42.0\n-\n40.60\n53.20\nMNSC-SQA-Part 4\n49.0\n39.6\n-\n36.60\n60.20\nMNSC-SQA-Part 5\n58.2\n51.6\n-\n44.60\n67.20\nMNSC-SQA-Part 6\n65.2\n53.6\n-\n46.80\n71.60\nSpoken Dialogue SummarizationLLM-as-a-Judge (↑)\nMNSC-SDS-Part 3\n46.80\n33.80\n-\n9.0\n45.40\nMNSC-SDS-Part 4\n45.80\n24.80\n-\n7.0\n44.00\nMNSC-SDS-Part 5\n55.2\n40.4\n-\n17.2\n58.00\nMNSC-SDS-Part 6\n61.8\n46.2\n-\n24.2\n65.40\nSpeech InstructionLLM-as-a-Judge (↑)\nOpenHermes-Audio\n71.4\n44.8\n22.40\n15.80\n72.20\nAlpaca-GPT4-Audio\n73.4\n52.6\n21.60\n17.20\n73.80\nParalinguisticsLLM-as-a-Judge (↑)\nVoxCeleb-Gender-Test\n99.53\n99.12\n69.68\n88.81\n35.25\nVoxCeleb-Accent-Test\n46.35\n29.18\n-\n34.22\n24.64\nMELD-Sentiment-Test\n42.26\n53.49\n50.08\n42.07\n56.67\nMELD-Emotion-Test\n30.15\n40.54\n41.07\n30.73\n47.39\nInference\nOut of Scope use: This model is not intended for use in tool calling, math, and coding tasks.\nvLLM Inference\nWe support hosting the model using vLLM framework.

The borda count corresponds to the average ranking of the models (see  (Colombo et al., 2022)). For Arc-challenge, Hellaswag, and MMLU we are using Okapi datasets (Lai et al., 2023) which include 11 languages. For MMLU-Pro and MUSR we translate the English version with Tower (Alves et al., 2024) to 6 EU languages.* As there are no public versions of the pre-trained models, we evaluated them using the post-trained versions.\nThe results in Table 1 highlight EuroLLM-9B's superior performance on multilingual tasks compared to other European-developed models (as shown by the Borda count of 1.0), as well as its strong competitiveness with non-European models, achieving results comparable to Gemma-2-9B and outperforming the rest on most benchmarks.\nEnglish\nTable 2: Comparison of open-weight LLMs on English general benchmarks.*  As there are no public versions of the pre-trained models, we evaluated them using the post-trained versions.\nThe results in Table 2 demonstrate EuroLLM's strong performance on English tasks, surpassing most European-developed models and matching the performance of Mistral-7B (obtaining the same Borda count).\nBias, Risks, and Limitations\nEuroLLM-9B has not been aligned to human preferences, so the model may generate problematic outputs (e.g., hallucinations, harmful content, or false statements).",

In 1927, Pascual Jordan tried to extend the canonical quantization of fields to the many-body wave functions of identical particles using a formalism which is known as statistical transformation theory; this procedure is now sometimes called second quantization. In 1928, Jordan and Eugene Wigner found that the quantum field describing electrons, or other fermions, had to be expanded using anti-commuting creation and annihilation operators due to the Pauli exclusion principle (see Jordan–Wigner transformation). This thread of development was incorporated into many-body theory and strongly influenced condensed matter physics and nuclear physics.\nAdS/CFT correspondenceIn quantum field theory, one typically computes the probabilities of various physical events using the techniques of perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman and others in the first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.\nWhen is the dialectical method used?\nDialect TestThe Dialect Test was created by A.J. Ellis in February 1879, and was used in the fieldwork for his work \"On Early English Pronunciation\". It stands as one of the earliest methods of identifying vowel sounds and features of speech. The aim was to capture the main vowel sounds of an individual dialect by listening to the reading of a short passage. All the categories of West Saxon words and vowels were included in the test so that comparisons could be made with the historic West Saxon speech as well as with various other dialects.\nFrankfurt SchoolMarx thus extensively relied on a form of dialectical analysis. This method—to know the truth by uncovering the contradictions in presently predominant ideas and, by extension, in the social relations to which they are linked—exposes the underlying struggle between opposing forces. For Marx, it is only by becoming aware of the dialectic (i.e., class consciousness) of such opposing forces, in a struggle for power, that individuals can liberate themselves and change the existing social order.\nHave the Colorado Rockies won a title?\nList of Colorado Rockies seasonsThe Colorado Rockies are a professional baseball team based in Denver, Colorado. The club has been owned since formation by Charles and Richard Monfort. The Rockies were created as an expansion team for the 1993 season and rose to a postseason appearance after three seasons and the 1994–95 strike. Since then they have played in the postseason four more times: in 2007 (when they lost the World Series to the Red Sox), 2009, 2017, and 2018. In 2012, the Rockies won only 64 games - the fewest in their history over a full season. They are one of the two MLB franchises that has never won a division title.\nHistory of the Colorado RockiesThe History of the Colorado Rockies began in 1991 when a Major League Baseball (MLB) expansion franchise for Denver, Colorado was granted to an ownership group headed by John Antonucci. In 1993, the Colorado Rockies started play in the National League (NL) West division. Since that date, the Rockies have reached the MLB postseason four times, each time as the National League wild card team. Twice (1995 and 2009) they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. In 2007, the Rockies advanced all the way to the World Series, only to be swept by the Boston Red Sox.\nLoss: MultipleNegativesRankingLoss with these parameters:{\n\"scale\":

بایستی توانایی‌های خویش در حل مسئله را بهبود ببخشند یکی از این راه‌ها بازی درمانی است. برخی بازی‌ها احساسات، برخی دیگر قدرت حل مسئله، برخی دیگر عضلات کوچک و برخی دیگر عضلات بزرگتر کودکان را در گیر می‌کند در این درگیری انرژی کودک تخلیه شده و احتمال اضطراب، پر تحرکی، افسردگی و سرخوردگی ناشی از این انرژی مازاد کاهش می یابد. تصویر کنید کودکی که نتواند ساده‌ترین مسائل زندگی خود مثل نظافت اتاق را انجام ندهد، این عدم توانایی در انجام فعالیت مربوطه وقتی با تذکرات خانواده نیز همراه باشد به او استرس زیادی تزریق می‌کند. در واقع سلامت جسمی کودکان بیشتر در گرو تغذیه و سلامتی روحی آن‌ها بیشتر در گرو حل مسئله، پایش و پویش در حوزه‌های مختلف است.\nبازی‌درمانیبازی درمانی کاربرد موقعیت‌های بازی در یک زمینه درمانی است. بازی درمانی شرایطی را فراهم می کند تا کودکان بتوانند با استفاده از روش های سالم احساسات و هیجانات خود را کشف کنند و آنها را بروز دهند. این کار می‌تواند به صورت فردی و گروهی انجام شود. در بازی درمانی، مشاور به عنوان درمانگر است اما این کار توسط والدین نیز می‌تواند صورت گیرد که تأثیر آن کمتر خواهد بود.  اولین وظیفه کودکان و از ضروریات زندگی آن‌ها بازی کردن است، آموزش مستقیم (آموزش‌هایی مانند خواندن و نوشتن، ریاضیات و علوم کلاسی) برای کودکان زیر ۷ سال بسیار مخرب و ویران گر است، بهترین روش آموزش به کودکان در سنین پائین از طریق بازی درمانی صورت میگیرد. بازی از ضروریات زندگی کودکان است، آن‌ها از طریق بازی افکارشان را بازگو می‌کنند. توانایی حل مسئله در کودکان از طریق تمرکز در بازی گسترش می یابد و به همین دلیل اعتماد به نفس و روحیه استقلال طلبی خودشان را تقویت می‌کنند.\nLoss: MultipleNegativesRankingLoss with these parameters:{\n\"scale\": 20.0,\n\"similarity_fct\":

تا مواد مغذی ضروری را برای بهترین عملکرد خود فراهم کند و می تواند به پیشگیری از بیماری های مزمن کمک کند.2. در فعالیت بدنی منظم شرکت کنید: ورزش برای حفظ استخوان ها، ماهیچه ها و سلامت قلب و عروق قوی بسیار مهم است. حداقل 150 دقیقه ورزش هوازی متوسط یا 75 دقیقه ورزش شدید در هفته را هدف قرار دهید.3. به اندازه کافی بخوابید: داشتن خواب با کیفیت کافی برای سلامت جسمی و روانی بسیار مهم است. به تنظیم خلق و

احاطه شده است توصیف کرد.هسته یک اتم از پروتون و نوترون تشکیل شده است. پروتون ها ذرات با بار مثبت و نوترون ها ذرات خنثی بدون بار هستند. هر دوی این ذرات در هسته اتم قرار دارند که در مرکز اتم قرار دارد و بیشتر جرم اتم را در خود دارد.دور هسته اتم ابری از الکترون است. الکترون ها ذراتی با بار منفی هستند که در اطراف هسته در حرکت ثابت هستند. ابر الکترونی به پوسته یا اوربیتال تقسیم می شود و هر پوسته می تواند تعداد معینی الکترون را در خود جای دهد. تعداد الکترون‌ها در بیرونی‌ترین پوسته که لایه ظرفیتی نام دارد، ویژگی‌های شیمیایی اتم را تعیین می‌کند.در یک اتم خنثی، تعداد پروتون های هسته برابر با تعداد الکترون های ابر الکترونی است، بنابراین بارهای مثبت و منفی متعادل می شوند و اتم بار کلی ندارد. تعداد پروتون ها که عدد اتمی نیز نامیده می شود، تعیین می کند که اتم چه عنصری است.\nLoss:

The model's context length is 4096 tokens, allowing it to generate around 54 seconds of audio in total. However, when a speaker profile is included, this capacity is reduced proportionally to the length of the speaker's audio clip.\nAudio Quality:\nEnsure the audio is clear and noise-free. Background noise or distortions can reduce the model's ability to extract accurate voice features.\nAccurate Transcription:\nProvide a highly accurate transcription of the audio clip. Mismatches between the audio and transcription can lead to suboptimal results.\nSpeaker Familiarity:\nThe model performs best with voices that are similar to those seen during training. Using a voice that is significantly different from typical training samples (e.g., unique accents, rare vocal characteristics) might result in inaccurate replication.\nIn such cases, you may need to fine-tune the model specifically on your target speaker's voice to achieve a better representation.\nParameter Adjustments:\nAdjust parameters like temperature in the generate function to refine the expressive quality and consistency of the synthesized voice.\nModel Specifications\nBase Model: Qwen-2.5-0.5B\nParameter Count: 500M\nLanguage Support:\nPrimary: English\nExperimental: Chinese, Japanese, Korean\nLicense: CC BY NC 4.0\nTraining Datasets\nEmilia-Dataset (CC BY NC 4.0)\nLibriTTS-R (CC BY 4.0)\nMultilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (CC BY 4.0)\nCredits & References\nWavTokenizer\nCTC Forced Alignment\nQwen-2.5-0.5B",

It employs a multi-scale Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture, where images are downsampled, divided into patches, and processed using a shared Dinov2 encoder. The extracted patch-level features are merged, upsampled, and refined using a DPT-like fusion stage, enabling precise depth estimation.\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\nWe present a foundation model for zero-shot metric monocular depth estimation. Our model, Depth Pro, synthesizes high-resolution depth maps with unparalleled sharpness and high-frequency details. The predictions are metric, with absolute scale, without relying on the availability of metadata such as camera intrinsics. And the model is fast, producing a 2.25-megapixel depth map in 0.3 seconds on a standard GPU. These characteristics are enabled by a number of technical contributions, including an efficient multi-scale vision transformer for dense prediction, a training protocol that combines real and synthetic datasets to achieve high metric accuracy alongside fine boundary tracing, dedicated evaluation metrics for boundary accuracy in estimated depth maps, and state-of-the-art focal length estimation from a single image. Extensive experiments analyze specific design choices and demonstrate that Depth Pro outperforms prior work along multiple dimensions.\nThis is the model card of a 🤗 transformers model that has been pushed on the Hub.\nDeveloped by: Aleksei Bochkovskii, Amaël Delaunoy, Hugo Germain, Marcel Santos, Yichao Zhou, Stephan R.

A small convolutional head ingests frozen features from the depth estimation network and task-specific features from a separate ViT image encoder to predict the horizontal angular field-of-view.\nCitation\nBibTeX:\n@misc{bochkovskii2024depthprosharpmonocular,\ntitle={Depth Pro: Sharp Monocular Metric Depth in Less Than a Second},\nauthor={Aleksei Bochkovskii and Amaël Delaunoy and Hugo Germain and Marcel Santos and Yichao Zhou and Stephan R.

(maybe not very optimized, but hey, it works!)\n日本語のモデルカードはこちら。\nPart of a personal project, focusing on further advancing Japanese speech field.\nUse the HuggingFace Space for Tsukasa (24khz):\nHuggingFace Space for Tsumugi (48khz):\nJoin Shoukan lab's discord server, a comfy place I frequently visit ->\nGithub's repo:\nWhat is this?\nNote: This model only supports the Japanese language; but you can feed it Romaji if you use the Gradio demo. (no longer, due to resource constraints, but the Tech is there.)\nThis is a speech generation network, aimed at maximizing the expressiveness and Controllability of the generated speech. at its core it uses StyleTTS 2's architecture with the following changes:\nIncorporating mLSTM Layers instead of regular PyTorch LSTM layers, and increasing the capacity of the text and prosody encoder by using a higher number of parameters\nRetrained PL-Bert, Pitch Extractor, Text Aligner from scratch\nWhisper's Encoder instead of WavLM for the SLM\n48khz Config\nimproved Performance on non-verbal sounds and cues. such as sigh, pauses, etc. and also very slightly on laughter (depends on the speaker)\na new way of sampling the Style Vectors.\nPromptable Speech Synthesizing.\na Smart Phonemization algorithm that can handle Romaji inputs or a mixture of Japanese and Romaji.\nFixed DDP and BF16 Training (mostly!)\nThere are two checkpoints you can use.

We're going the opposite way, trying to see how far we can push the limits by utilizing existing tools.\nMaybe, just maybe, scale is not necessarily the answer.\nThere's also a few things that's related to Japanese (but can have a wider impact on languages that face a similar issue like Arabic). such as how we can improve the intonations for this language. what can be done to accurately annotate a text that can have various spellings depending on the context, etc.\nHow to do ...\nPre-requisites\nPython >= 3.11\nClone this repository:\ngit clone https://huggingface.co/Respair/Tsukasa_Speech\ncd Tsukasa_Speech\nInstall python requirements:\npip install -r requirements.txt\nInference:\nGradio demo:\npython app_tsuka.py\nor check the inference notebook. before that, make sure you read the Important Notes section down below.\nTraining:\nBefore starting remove lines 985 and 986 from models.py also remove \"KotoDama_Prompt, KotoDama_Text\" from the \"build_model\" function's parameters.\nFirst stage training:\naccelerate launch train_first.py --config_path ./Configs/config.yml\nSecond stage training:\naccelerate launch accelerate_train_second.py --config_path ./Configs/config.yml\nSLM Joint-Training doesn't work on multigpu.

By design, all Pleias model are unable to output copyrighted content.\nExtensive multilingual support for main European languages.\nA new tokenizer designed for enhanced document processing tasks and better multilingual support.\nExtremely low level of toxicity and problematic content.\nFully supported languages include English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch, Latin and Portuguese.\nRecommended use\nAs a base model, Pleias-3b-Preview is only able to run continuation prompts.\nText generation is currently able to support a range of creative writing tasks in multiple European languages. For more consistent results we recommend using a low or null temperature with a slight repetition penalty (1.1-1.2).\nPleias-3b-Preview has been successfully adapted for continuous pretraining and full-fine-tuning on document processing tasks such as RAG, translation or OCR correction. Given the small size of the model we do not recommend fine-tuning methods based on LORA.\nTraining\nPleias-3b-Preview was fully pretrained at Jean Zay on 192 h100s for about 20 days (compute grant n°GC011015451) with support from Etalab. Training code relied on Nanotron, the open source library from HuggingFace. We provide the complete settings as a yaml file as part of our release.\nTraining schedule includes 518,000 steps (batch size 1,024) on a filtered and enhanced version of Common Corpus (1,086,324,736,000 tokens).\nTraining Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Estimated total location-based greenhouse gas emissions were 16 tons CO2eq for training.\nEthical Considerations\npleias-3B-Preview model, like all large language models, carries inherent ethical risks that require careful consideration. Our approach to mitigating these risks begins at the data level, where we exclusively use vetted sources, deliberately excluding CommonCrawl. The primary challenge comes from our public domain dataset component, which contains historical texts that may reflect outdated social norms and potentially harmful language, particularly regarding minoritized groups.\nTo address this, we implemented a systematic ethical filtering process using toxicity classifiers to identify extremely harmful content. We also employed synthetic rewriting techniques to transform mildly problematic passages while preserving the underlying informational value. This process significantly reduced potential societal harm without compromising the dataset's size or textual quality, resulting in notably low toxicity scores in benchmarks compared to other models.\nDespite these preventive measures, users should be aware that the model has not undergone additional safety alignment procedures and may still produce problematic outputs. The model's capabilities in generative AI tasks must be balanced against the risks of bias, misinformation propagation, and autonomous decision-making challenges. We explicitly prohibit any malicious utilization and emphasize the responsibility of users to implement appropriate safeguards.\nAt Pleias, we continue to research and develop improved methods for creating safer and more equitable models and datasets. This includes ongoing work in toxicity reduction, bias mitigation, and the development of more sophisticated ethical filtering techniques.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work would not have been possible without the substantial support from étalab.\nThe training was conducted as part of the Grand Challenge of GENCI, aligned with the European strategy for establishing AI factories through the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, aimed at supporting European startups and providing open-source models to the community.\nWe express our gratitude to GENCI's Jean Zay supercomputer, France's AI flagship facility, which was instrumental in our model's training. The project benefited from the new NVIDIA H100 partition specifically dedicated to the French AI community. We appreciate the generous allocation of compute hours over five months and the invaluable technical expertise provided by IDRIS, EVIDEN, and NVIDIA (as well as its Inception program).\nWe are deeply grateful to the Mozilla Foundation Local AI Program for their generous support.\nFinally, we acknowledge the significant contributions from the open science LLM community, particularly HuggingFace, Eleuther AI and Allen AI whose insights and cooperation have been invaluable to our work.\nUpdate\nPleias-3b-Preview is currently released as an early preview.\nThe model will undergo several more round of post-training to enhance reasoning capacities and fine-tunability as well as in anticipation of a generalist instruct version.",
