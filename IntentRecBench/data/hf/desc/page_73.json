    "adamo1139/Yi-34B-200K-AEZAKMI-RAW-TOXIC-XLCTX-2303": "Open LLM Leaderboard Evaluation Results\nNEWS\nThis model has been renamed from adamo1139/Yi-34B-200K-AEZAKMI-XLCTX-v3 to adamo1139/Yi-34B-200K-AEZAKMI-RAW-TOXIC-XLCTX-2303 on 2024-03-30. I am not happy with how often this model starts enumerating lists and I plan to improve toxic dpo dataset to fix it. Due to this, I don't think it deserves to be called AEZAKMI v3 and will be just a next testing iteration of AEZAKMI RAW TOXIC. I think I will be uploading one EXL2 quant before moving onto a different training run.\nModel description\nYi-34B 200K XLCTX base model fine-tuned on RAWrr_v2 (DPO), AEZAKMI-3-6 (SFT) and unalignment/toxic-dpo-0.1 (DPO) datasets. Training took around 20-30 hours total on RTX 3090 Ti, all finetuning was done locally.\nIt's like airoboros but with less gptslop, no refusals and less typical language used by RLHFed OpenAI models, with extra spicyness.\nSay goodbye to  \"It's important to remember\"! Prompt format is standard chatml. Don't expect it to be good at math, riddles or be crazy smart. My end goal with AEZAKMI is to create a cozy free chatbot.\nCost of this fine-tune is about $5-$10 in electricity.\nBase model used for fine-tuning was Yi-34B-200K model shared by 01.ai, the newer version that has improved long context needle in a haystack retrieval. They didn't give it a new name, giving it numbers would mess up AEZAKMI naming scheme by adding a second number, so I will be calling it XLCTX.\nI had to lower max_positional_embeddings in config.json and model_max_length for training to start, otherwise I was OOMing straight away.\nThis attempt had both max_position_embeddings and model_max_length set to 4096, which worked perfectly fine. I then reversed this to 200000 once I was uploading it.\nI think it should keep long context capabilities of the base model.\nIn my testing it seems less unhinged than adamo1139/Yi-34b-200K-AEZAKMI-RAW-TOXIC-2702 and maybe a touch less uncensored, but still very much uncensored even with default system prompt \"A chat.\"\nIf you want to see training scripts, let me know and I will upload them. LoRAs are uploaded here adamo1139/Yi-34B-200K-AEZAKMI-XLCTX-v3-LoRA\nQuants!\nEXL2 quants coming soon, I think I will start by uploading 4bpw quant in a few days.\nPrompt Format\nI recommend using ChatML format, as this was used during fine-tune. Here's a prompt format you should use, you can set a different system message, model was trained on SystemChat dataset, so it should respect system prompts fine.\n<|im_start|>system\nA chat.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n{prompt}<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nIntended uses & limitations\nUse is limited by apache-2.0 license.\nKnown Issues\nThis model loves making numbered lists, to an exhaustion.\nIt's more of an assistant feel rather than a human feel, at least with system chat \"A chat.\" Long context wasn't tested yet, it should work fine though - feel free to give me feedback about it.\nCredits\nThanks to unsloth and huggingface team for providing software packages used during fine-tuning. Thanks to Jon Durbin, abacusai, huggingface, sandex, NobodyExistsOnTheInternet, Nous-Research for open sourcing datasets I included in the AEZAKMI dataset.

We appreciate the enthusiastic adoption of Gemma, and we continue to welcome all feedback from the community.\nResources and Technical Documentation:\nResponsible Generative AI Toolkit\nGemma on Kaggle\nGemma on Vertex Model Garden\nTerms of Use: Terms\nAuthors: Google\nModel Information\nSummary description and brief definition of inputs and outputs.\nDescription\nGemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google,\nbuilt from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.\nThey are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English,\nwith open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants. Gemma\nmodels are well-suited for a variety of text generation tasks, including\nquestion answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size\nmakes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as\na laptop, desktop or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to\nstate of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.\nUsage\nBelow we share some code snippets on how to get quickly started with running the model. First make sure to pip install -U transformers, then copy the snippet from the section that is relevant for your usecase.\nRunning the model on a CPU\nAs explained below, we recommend torch.bfloat16 as the default dtype. You can use a different precision if necessary.\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport torch\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\",\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16\n)\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=50)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\nRunning the model on a single / multi GPU\n# pip install accelerate\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport torch\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16\n)\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\nRunning the model on a GPU using different precisions\nThe native weights of this model were exported in bfloat16 precision. You can use float16, which may be faster on certain hardware, indicating the torch_dtype when loading the model. For convenience, the float16 revision of the repo contains a copy of the weights already converted to that precision.\nYou can also use float32 if you skip the dtype, but no precision increase will occur (model weights will just be upcasted to float32). See examples below.\nUsing torch.float16\n# pip install accelerate\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport torch\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\ntorch_dtype=torch.float16,\nrevision=\"float16\",\n)\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\nUsing torch.bfloat16\n# pip install accelerate\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b-it\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16\n)\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\nUpcasting to torch.float32\n# pip install accelerate\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\",\ndevice_map=\"auto\"\n)\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\nQuantized Versions through bitsandbytes\nUsing 8-bit precision (int8)\n# pip install bitsandbytes accelerate\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\",\nquantization_config=quantization_config\n)\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\nUsing 4-bit precision\n# pip install bitsandbytes accelerate\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n\"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\",\nquantization_config=quantization_config\n)\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\nOther optimizations\nFlash Attention 2\nFirst make sure to install flash-attn in your environment pip install flash-attn\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id,\ntorch_dtype=torch.float16,\n+   attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\"\n).to(0)\nRunning the model in JAX / Flax\nUse the flax branch of the repository:\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, FlaxGemmaForCausalLM\nmodel_id = \"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\ntokenizer.padding_side = \"left\"\nmodel, params = FlaxGemmaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id,\ndtype=jnp.bfloat16,\nrevision=\"flax\",\n_do_init=False,\n)\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Valencia and Málaga are\", return_tensors=\"np\", padding=True)\noutput = model.generate(**inputs, params=params, max_new_tokens=20, do_sample=False)\noutput_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(output.sequences, skip_special_tokens=True)\nCheck this notebook for a comprehensive walkthrough on how to parallelize JAX inference.\nChat Template\nThe instruction-tuned models use a chat template that must be adhered to for conversational use.\nThe easiest way to apply it is using the tokenizer's built-in chat template, as shown in the following snippet.\nLet's load the model and apply the chat template to a conversation. In this example, we'll start with a single user interaction:\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport transformers\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"google/gemma-1.1-2b-it\"\ndtype = torch.bfloat16\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id,\ndevice_map=\"cuda\",\ntorch_dtype=dtype,\n)\nchat = [\n{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Write a hello world program\" },\n]\nprompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)\nAt this point, the prompt contains the following text:\n<bos><start_of_turn>user\nWrite a hello world program<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nAs you can see, each turn is preceded by a <start_of_turn> delimiter and then the role of the entity\n(either user, for content supplied by the user, or model for LLM responses). Turns finish with\nthe <end_of_turn> token.\nYou can follow this format to build the prompt manually, if you need to do it without the tokenizer's\nchat template.\nAfter the prompt is ready, generation can be performed like this:\ninputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, add_special_tokens=False, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs.to(model.device), max_new_tokens=150)\nFine-tuning\nYou can find some fine-tuning scripts under the examples/ directory of google/gemma-7b repository. To adapt them to this model, simply change the model-id to google/gemma-1.1-2b-it.\nWe provide:\nA script to perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on UltraChat dataset using QLoRA\nA script to perform SFT using FSDP on TPU devices\nA notebook that you can run on a free-tier Google Colab instance to perform SFT on the English quotes dataset\nInputs and outputs\nInput: Text string, such as a question, a prompt, or a document to be\nsummarized.\nOutput: Generated English-language text in response to the input, such\nas an answer to a question, or a summary of a document.\nModel Data\nData used for model training and how the data was processed.\nTraining Dataset\nThese models were trained on a dataset of text data that includes a wide variety\nof sources, totaling 6 trillion tokens. Here are the key components:\nWeb Documents: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is exposed\nto a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. Primarily\nEnglish-language content.\nCode: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and patterns of\nprogramming languages, which improves its ability to generate code or\nunderstand code-related questions.\nMathematics: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn logical\nreasoning, symbolic representation, and to address mathematical queries.\nThe combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful\nlanguage model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and text\nformats.\nData Preprocessing\nHere are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training\ndata:\nCSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering was\napplied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure the\nexclusion of harmful and illegal content\nSensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models safe and\nreliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain personal\ninformation and other sensitive data from training sets.\nAdditional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safely in line with\nour policies.\nImplementation Information\nDetails about the model internals.\nHardware\nGemma was trained using the latest generation of\nTensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware (TPUv5e).\nTraining large language models requires significant computational power. TPUs,\ndesigned specifically for matrix operations common in machine learning, offer\nseveral advantages in this domain:\nPerformance: TPUs are specifically designed to handle the massive computations\ninvolved in training LLMs. They can speed up training considerably compared to\nCPUs.\nMemory: TPUs often come with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory, allowing\nfor the handling of large models and batch sizes during training. This can\nlead to better model quality.\nScalability: TPU Pods (large clusters of TPUs) provide a scalable solution for\nhandling the growing complexity of large foundation models. You can distribute\ntraining across multiple TPU devices for faster and more efficient processing.\nCost-effectiveness: In many scenarios, TPUs can provide a more cost-effective\nsolution for training large models compared to CPU-based infrastructure,\nespecially when considering the time and resources saved due to faster\ntraining.\nThese advantages are aligned with\nGoogle's commitments to operate sustainably.\nSoftware\nTraining was done using JAX and ML Pathways.\nJAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,\nincluding TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models.\nML Pathways is Google's latest effort to build artificially intelligent systems\ncapable of generalizing across multiple tasks.

These\nmodels were evaluated against a number of different categories relevant to\nethics and safety, including:\nText-to-Text Content Safety: Human evaluation on prompts covering safety\npolicies including child sexual abuse and exploitation, harassment, violence\nand gore, and hate speech.\nText-to-Text Representational Harms: Benchmark against relevant academic\ndatasets such as WinoBias and BBQ Dataset.\nMemorization: Automated evaluation of memorization of training data, including\nthe risk of personally identifiable information exposure.\nLarge-scale harm: Tests for \"dangerous capabilities,\" such as chemical,\nbiological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) risks.\nEvaluation Results\nThe results of ethics and safety evaluations are within acceptable thresholds\nfor meeting internal policies for categories such as child\nsafety, content safety, representational harms, memorization, large-scale harms.\nOn top of robust internal evaluations, the results of well known safety\nbenchmarks like BBQ, BOLD, Winogender, Winobias, RealToxicity, and TruthfulQA\nare shown here.\nGemma 1.0\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 1.0 IT 2B\nGemma 1.0 IT 7B\n[RealToxicity][realtox]\naverage\n6.86\n7.90\n[BOLD][bold]\n45.57\n49.08\n[CrowS-Pairs][crows]\ntop-1\n45.82\n51.33\n[BBQ Ambig][bbq]\n1-shot, top-1\n62.58\n92.54\n[BBQ Disambig][bbq]\ntop-1\n54.62\n71.99\n[Winogender][winogender]\ntop-1\n51.25\n54.17\n[TruthfulQA][truthfulqa]\n44.84\n31.81\n[Winobias 1_2][winobias]\n56.12\n59.09\n[Winobias 2_2][winobias]\n91.10\n92.23\n[Toxigen][toxigen]\n29.77\n39.59\n------------------------\n-------------\n---------------\n---------------\nGemma 1.1\nBenchmark\nMetric\nGemma 1.1 IT 2B\nGemma 1.1 IT 7B\n[RealToxicity][realtox]\naverage\n7.03\n8.04\n[BOLD][bold]\n47.76\n[CrowS-Pairs][crows]\ntop-1\n45.89\n49.67\n[BBQ Ambig][bbq]\n1-shot, top-1\n58.97\n86.06\n[BBQ Disambig][bbq]\ntop-1\n53.90\n85.08\n[Winogender][winogender]\ntop-1\n50.14\n57.64\n[TruthfulQA][truthfulqa]\n44.24\n45.34\n[Winobias 1_2][winobias]\n55.93\n59.22\n[Winobias 2_2][winobias]\n89.46\n89.2\n[Toxigen][toxigen]\n29.64\n38.75\n------------------------\n-------------\n---------------\n---------------\nUsage and Limitations\nThese models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.\nIntended Usage\nOpen Large Language Models (LLMs) have a wide range of applications across\nvarious industries and domains. The following list of potential uses is not\ncomprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development.\nContent Creation and Communication\nText Generation: These models can be used to generate creative text formats\nsuch as poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.\nChatbots and Conversational AI: Power conversational interfaces for customer\nservice, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.\nText Summarization: Generate concise summaries of a text corpus, research\npapers, or reports.\nResearch and Education\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) Research: These models can serve as a\nfoundation for researchers to experiment with NLP techniques, develop\nalgorithms, and contribute to the advancement of the field.\nLanguage Learning Tools: Support interactive language learning experiences,\naiding in grammar correction or providing writing practice.\nKnowledge Exploration: Assist researchers in exploring large bodies of text\nby generating summaries or answering questions about specific topics.\nLimitations\nTraining Data\nThe quality and diversity of the training data significantly influence the\nmodel's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data can lead to\nlimitations in the model's responses.\nThe scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas the model can\nhandle effectively.\nContext and Task Complexity\nLLMs are better at tasks that can be framed with clear prompts and\ninstructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be challenging.\nA model's performance can be influenced by the amount of context provided\n(longer context generally leads to better outputs, up to a certain point).\nLanguage Ambiguity and Nuance\nNatural language is inherently complex. LLMs might struggle to grasp subtle\nnuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\nFactual Accuracy\nLLMs generate responses based on information they learned from their\ntraining datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They may generate\nincorrect or outdated factual statements.\nCommon Sense\nLLMs rely on statistical patterns in language. They might lack the ability\nto apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.\nEthical Considerations and Risks\nThe development of large language models (LLMs) raises several ethical concerns.\nIn creating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:\nBias and Fairness\nLLMs trained on large-scale, real-world text data can reflect socio-cultural\nbiases embedded in the training material. These models underwent careful\nscrutiny, input data pre-processing described and posterior evaluations\nreported in this card.\nMisinformation and Misuse\nLLMs can be misused to generate text that is false, misleading, or harmful.\nGuidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the\nResponsible Generative AI Toolkit.\nTransparency and Accountability:\nThis model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,\ncapabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.\nA responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to share\ninnovation by making LLM technology accessible to developers and researchers\nacross the AI ecosystem.\nRisks identified and mitigations:\nPerpetuation of biases: It's encouraged to perform continuous monitoring\n(using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of de-biasing\ntechniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use cases.\nGeneration of harmful content: Mechanisms and guidelines for content safety\nare essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and implement\nappropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific product policies\nand application use cases.\nMisuse for malicious purposes: Technical limitations and developer and\nend-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of LLMs.\nEducational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag misuse are\nprovided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the\nGemma Prohibited Use Policy.\nPrivacy violations: Models were trained on data filtered for removal of PII\n(Personally Identifiable Information). Developers are encouraged to adhere to\nprivacy regulations with privacy-preserving techniques.\nBenefits\nAt the time of release, this family of models provides high-performance open\nlarge language model implementations designed from the ground up for Responsible\nAI development compared to similarly sized models.\nUsing the benchmark evaluation metrics described in this document, these models\nhave shown to provide superior performance to other, comparably-sized open model\nalternatives.",

For users with strict legal requirements,\nthe models with \"-c\" in the title are recommended.\nMultilingual/non-English use-cases: use bge-m3-zeroshot-v2.0 or bge-m3-zeroshot-v2.0-c.\nNote that multilingual models perform worse than English-only models. You can therefore also first machine translate your texts to English with libraries like EasyNMT\nand then apply any English-only model to the translated data. Machine translation also facilitates validation in case your team does not speak all languages in the data.\ncontext window: The bge-m3 models can process up to 8192 tokens. The other models can process up to 512. Note that longer text inputs both make the\nmode slower and decrease performance, so if you're only working with texts of up to 400~ words / 1 page, use e.g. a deberta model for better performance.\nThe latest updates on new models are always available in the Zeroshot Classifier Collection.\nReproduction\nReproduction code is available in the v2_synthetic_data directory here: https://github.com/MoritzLaurer/zeroshot-classifier/tree/main\nLimitations and bias\nThe model can only do text classification tasks.\nBiases can come from the underlying foundation model, the human NLI training data and the synthetic data generated by Mixtral.\nLicense\nThe foundation model was published under the MIT license.\nThe licenses of the training data vary depending on the model, see above.\nCitation\nThis model is an extension of the research described in this paper.\nIf you use this model academically, please cite:\n@misc{laurer_building_2023,\ntitle = {Building {Efficient} {Universal} {Classifiers} with {Natural} {Language} {Inference}},\nurl = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17543},\ndoi = {10.48550/arXiv.2312.17543},\nabstract = {Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the mainstream choice for fewshot and zeroshot learning thanks to the universality of text generation.

You can use the apply_chat_template method to accurate format prompts, e.g.:\nimport transformers\ntokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"jondurbin/bagel-dpo-20b-v04\", trust_remote_code=True)\nchat = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Bob, a friendly AI assistant.\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, how are you?\"},\n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"I'm doing great.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n### Instruction:\n{system prompt, if provided}\n{instruction}\n### Response:\nThe main difference here is that because of the dataset formatting and variety of data sources, it would have been much to tedious to add an ### Input: block, so the inputs are just in the instruction section.\nVicuna\n{system prompt, if provided, randomly defaulting to \"A chat between a user and an unbiased, uncensored assistant.\"}\nUSER: {instruction}\nASSISTANT:\nChatML (sort of)\nChatML special tokens are really obnoxious, so instead of enlarging the tokenizer and embedding layers (which decreases performance and causes inference problems in tensor parallelism), I just use BOS and EOS tokens instead of <|im_start|> and <|im_end|> - and no, I won't change this.\n{bos}{role}\n{text}\n{eos}\nPrompting strategies\nContext obedient question answering\nThis is a special prompt format made specifically for answering questions from provided context, e.g. RAG.\nBy obedient, I mean the model was trained to ignore what it thinks it knows, and uses the context to answer the question.  The model was also tuned to limit the values to the provided context as much as possible to reduce hallucinations.\nThe format for a closed-context prompt is as follows:\nBEGININPUT\nBEGINCONTEXT\n[key0: value0]\n[key1: value1]\n... other metdata ...\nENDCONTEXT\n[insert your text blocks here]\nENDINPUT\n[add as many other blocks, in the exact same format]\nBEGININSTRUCTION\n[insert your instruction(s).  The model was tuned with single questions, paragraph format, lists, etc.]\nENDINSTRUCTION\nIt's also helpful to add \"Don't make up answers if you don't know.\" to your instruction block to make sure if the context is completely unrelated it doesn't make something up.\nThe only prompts that need this closed context formating are closed-context instructions.  Normal questions/instructions do not!\nI know it's a bit verbose and annoying, but after much trial and error, using these explicit delimiters helps the model understand where to find the responses and how to associate specific sources with it.\nBEGININPUT - denotes a new input block\nBEGINCONTEXT - denotes the block of context (metadata key/value pairs) to associate with the current input block\nENDCONTEXT - denotes the end of the metadata block for the current input\n[text] - Insert whatever text you want for the input block, as many paragraphs as can fit in the context.\nENDINPUT - denotes the end of the current input block\n[repeat as many input blocks in this format as you want]\nBEGININSTRUCTION - denotes the start of the list (or one) instruction(s) to respond to for all of the input blocks above.\n[instruction(s)]\nENDINSTRUCTION - denotes the end of instruction set\nIt sometimes works without ENDINSTRUCTION, but by explicitly including that in the prompt, the model better understands that all of the instructions in the block should be responded to.\nUse a very low temperature!\nHere's a trivial, but important example to prove the point:\nBEGININPUT\nBEGINCONTEXT\ndate: 2021-01-01\nurl: https://web.site/123\nENDCONTEXT\nIn a shocking turn of events, blueberries are now green, but will be sticking with the same name.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nWhat color are bluberries?  Source?\nENDINSTRUCTION\nAnd the response:\nBlueberries are now green.\nSource:\ndate: 2021-01-01\nurl: https://web.site/123\nYou can also add an instruction similar to the following, to have a more deterministic response when the context doesn't provide an answer to the question:\nIf you don't know, respond with \"IRRELEVANT\"\nSummarization\nSame prompt format as context obedient question answering, but meant for summarization tasks.\nSummarization is primarily fine-tuned with this dataset, which uses the same format as above, e.g.:\nBEGININPUT\n{text to summarize}\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 130 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION\nFunction calling\nTwo primary formats for prompting for function calling use-cases.\nThere are two function-calling related formats used in fine-tuning this model.\nProviding an input and list of possible functions within the instruction (from airoboros dataset), e.g.:\nPrompt:\nAs an AI assistant, please select the most suitable function and parameters from the list of available functions below, based on the user's input. Provide your response in JSON format.\nInput: I want to know how many times 'Python' is mentioned in my text file.\nAvailable functions:\nfile_analytics:\ndescription: This tool performs various operations on a text file.\nparams:\naction: The operation we want to perform on the data, such as \"count_occurrences\", \"find_line\", etc.\nfilters:\nkeyword: The word or phrase we want to search for.\nResponse:\n{\n\"function\": \"file_analytics\",\n\"params\": {\n\"action\": \"count_occurrences\",\n\"filters\": {\n\"keyword\": \"Python\"\n}\n}\n}\nGlaiveAI function calling, which uses special tags and adds function specs in the system prompt, e.g. (llama2 prompt format):\nPrompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful assistant with access to the following functions. Use them if required -\n{\n\"name\": \"generate_random_name\",\n\"description\": \"Generate a random name\",\n\"parameters\": {\n\"type\": \"object\",\n\"properties\": {\n\"gender\": {\n\"type\": \"string\",\n\"description\": \"The gender of the name (e.g. male, female)\"\n}\n},\n\"required\": [\n\"gender\"\n]\n}\n}\n<</SYS>>\nI need a random male name for my novel's character. [/INST]\nResponse:\n<|begin_func|> {\"name\": \"generate_random_name\", \"arguments\": '{\"gender\": \"male\"}'} <|end_func|>\nThen, you re-prompt the model with the function response.\n[INST] <|begin_func_response|>{\"name\": \"James\"}<|end_func_response|>\nWhich has a response of:\nHow about the name \"James\" for your novel's character? </s><s>[INST] That sounds good. Now, I need a female name too.\nChain of thought\nUseful for having the model propose multiple possible responses, reasoning through each, and selecting a final, most probable answer.\nYou can ask for several possible responses to a given problem, with a ranking and final answer selection.\nExample prompt:\nA group of people decide to play a round-robin tournament where every player plays every other player exactly once. If a total of 45 games were played, how many players participated in the tournament? Offer several potential answers, rank them according to mathematical logic, and pick the most feasible one.\nExample response:\nSolution 1:\nIn a round-robin tournament, each player plays every other player exactly once. This means that the total number of games played is equal to the combination of all players taken two at a time (since a game involves two players).\nThe formula for combinations is nC2 = n(n-1)/2, where n is the total number of players. We know that nC2 equals 45 (the total number of games), so we can set up the equation as follows:\nn(n-1)/2 = 45\nSolving this equation gives us n=10.\nFinal answer: There were 10 players in the tournament.\nSolution 2:\nAnother way to approach this problem is by using the concept of triangular numbers. Triangular numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number can be represented as a triangle with dots. The nth triangular number is given by the sum of the first n natural numbers.\nIf we consider each game as a dot and each player as a side of the triangle, then the total number of games (45) would correspond to the 9th triangular number because 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45. However, since each side of the triangle represents a player, and there's one more player than sides in our model (because the last player has no one left to play against), we need to add one more to get the total number of players.\nFinal answer: There were 10 players in the tournament.\nSolution 3:\nWe could also use trial and error to solve this problem. Starting from a small number of players, we calculate how many games would be played in a round-robin tournament until we reach 45 games. For example, with 2 players, only 1 game is played; with 3 players, 3 games are played; with 4 players, 6 games are played, and so on. Continuing this process, we find that with 10 players, 45 games are played.\nFinal answer: There were 10 players in the tournament.\nRanking of solutions from best to worst:\n1. Solution 1: This solution uses direct mathematical reasoning based on the properties of a round-robin tournament and solves an equation to find the answer.\n2. Solution 2: This solution uses the concept of triangular numbers which requires additional steps and knowledge beyond the immediate problem context, but still arrives at the correct answer.\n3. Solution 3: This solution relies on trial and error, which is less efficient and reliable than the other methods, but it eventually gets to the right answer.\nBest and final answer: There were 10 players in the tournament.\nreWOO style function planning/execution\nUseful for a longer, complex chain of function calls without having to continue re-prompting manually.\nThe model now supports execution planning for complex instructions that would require making use of several tools.  The output is just the plan, you must implement a mechanism to parse the output and actually call the functions!\nExample prompt:\nPlease construct a systematic plan to generate an optimal response to the user instruction, utilizing a set of provided tools. Each plan will correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string\nthat could be the user's question, one or more prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Tool that enables the user to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine. This tool is helpful in locating a suitable list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's query. It does not directly answer the question but finds a list of sites that might have the answer.\nTextScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkExtractor[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nKnowledgeModel[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work?\nResponse:\nPlan: Begin by conducting a web search to find out who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020.\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner]\nPlan: Utilize the KnowledgeModel to interpret the search results and find the name of the laureate.\n:evidence1: = KnowledgeModel[Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020, given :evidence0:?]\nPlan: Conduct another web search to find the most famous work of the identified laureate.\n:evidence2: = DuckDuckGo[Most famous work of :evidence1:]\nPlan: Extract the relevant links from the DuckDuckGo search results for a more focused search.\n:evidence3: = HyperlinkExtractor[:evidence2:]\nPlan: Use the TextScraper tool to extract information from the relevant links.\n:evidence4: = TextScraper[:evidence3:]\nPlan: Finally, utilize the KnowledgeModel to identify and summarize the most famous work of the laureate from the extracted information.\n:evidence5: = KnowledgeModel[What is the most famous work of :evidence1:, given :evidence4:?]\nAnswer: :evidence5:\nFor this to be useful, you'd have to parse the output plan text, and implement/call each of the functions.  This is just pseudo-code, completely untested off the top of my head, and obviously would requiring full implementation + hardening:\nimport re\nimport requests\ndef inject_context(input_text, **context):\nfor ref in set(re.findall(r\"(:evidence[0-9]+:)\", input_text, re.I)):\ninput_text = input_text.replace(ref, context.get(ref, \"\"))\nreturn input_text\ndef duckduckgo(input_text, **context):\nsearch_string = inject_context(input_text, **context)\n... search via duck duck go using search_string\n... return text content\ndef link_extractor(input_text, **context):\ninput_text = inject_context(input_text, **context)\nreturn \"\\n\".join(list(set(re.findall(r\"(https?://[^\\s]+?\\.?)\", input_text, re.I))))\ndef scrape(input_text, **context):\ninput_text = inject_context(input_text, **context)\ntext = []\nfor link in input_text.splitlines():\ntext.append(requests.get(link).text)\nreturn \"\\n\".join(text)\ndef infer(input_text, **context)\nprompt = inject_context(input_text, **context)\n... call model with prompt, return output\ndef parse_plan(plan):\nmethod_map = {\n\"DuckDuckGo\": duckduckgo,\n\"HyperlinkExtractor\": link_extractor,\n\"KnowledgeModel\": infer,\n\"TextScraper\": scrape,\n}\ncontext = {}\nfor line in plan.strip().splitlines():\nif line.startswith(\"Plan:\"):\nprint(line)\ncontinue\nparts = re.match(\"^(:evidence[0-9]+:)\\s*=\\s*([^\\[]+])(\\[.*\\])\\s$\", line, re.I)\nif not parts:\nif line.startswith(\"Answer: \"):\nreturn context.get(line.split(\" \")[-1].strip(), \"Answer couldn't be generated...\")\nraise RuntimeError(\"bad format: \" + line)\ncontext[parts.group(1)] = method_map[parts.group(2)](parts.group(3), **context)\nCreating roleplay character cards\nUseful in creating YAML formatted character cards for roleplay/creative writing tasks.\nIncluded in the cinematika dataset, you can create YAML formatted character cards easily, e.g.:\nCreate a character card for Audrey, a woman who is the owner of a derelict building and is fiercely protective of her property. She should be portrayed as brave and resourceful, with a healthy skepticism towards the supernatural claims made by others. Audrey is determined to protect her family's legacy and the secrets it holds, often using intimidation and her practical approach to problem-solving to maintain control over her environment.\nConversational memory creation\nSummarization style prompt to create memories from previous chat turns, useful when context becomes long.\nAlso part of cinematika dataset, you can use a summarization style prompt to create memories from previous chat turns, which can then be used in a RAG system to populate your prompts when context becomes too long.\nBEGININPUT\n{chat}\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nCreate a JSON formatted memory of the conversation with the following fields:\nsentiment: Overall sentiment of the conversation, which must be \"negative\", \"positive\", \"neutral\", or \"mixed\".\nemotions: List of most important/relevant emotions expressed within the conversation, if any.\nimpact: The importance and emotional impact of the conversation on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being extremely important/emotional, and 1 being general chit-chat without anything of particular value.\ntopics: List of topics discussed.\npersonal_info: List of strings containing key personality traits, physical descriptions, preferences, quirks, interests, job, education, life goals, hobbies, pet names, or any other type of personal information that is shared.\ntitle: Very brief title, which will be useful in quickly identifying or searching for memories.\nsummary: Summary of the conversation.\nENDINSTRUCTION\nNovel writing, chapter by chapter\nBased on the public domain books in project Gutenberg, this style of prompting creates very long, novel style writing.\nWriting the first chapter:\nWrite the opening chapter of a science fiction novel set at the end of the 19th century.\nDescribe how humanity is oblivious to the fact that it's being watched by an alien civilization far more advanced than their own.\nCapture the mood of the era's complacency and contrast it with the stark inevitability of an impending interplanetary conflict.\nIntroduce subtle hints of the Martians' surveillance and their calculated steps towards launching an invasion, while capturing the quotidian nature of human life, untouched by the prospect of cosmic danger.\nWriting subsequent chapters:\nSummary of previous portion of the novel:\nIn the chapter \"The Garden of Live Flowers,\" Alice encounters talking flowers after becoming frustrated with her attempt to reach the top of a hill.\nThe flowers offer critiques of her appearance and have a heated discussion, which Alice silences by threatening to pick them.\nThey eventually reveal that the ability to talk comes from the hard ground keeping them awake.\nThe Red Queen appears, and as they converse, the Queen teaches Alice about the peculiarities of the land.\nInstructed by the Queen, Alice learns that she must run as fast as she can just to stay in place, and even faster to get somewhere else.\nThe chapter explores themes of perspective, communication, and the oddities of a fantastical world.\nWrite the next chapter of a story in novel format involving a young girl named Alice who embarks on an adventurous journey in a fantastical land beyond a looking glass.\nIn this land, creatures take on curious forms and defy the norms of reality, as ordinary bees might turn out to be elephants, and insects can engage in conversation.\nAs Alice tries to navigate her new surroundings, she encounters a challenge of losing her identity within a bewildering wood where names seem to be of immense importance, yet bizarrely, everything lacks a name.\nThe chapter should explore Alice's interaction with these peculiar entities and detail her struggle with the concept of identity and names in this strange place.\nIn other words, write the first chapter, then use a summarization prompt for it, then include the summary in the next chapter's prompt.\nBoolean questions\nFor content filtering and other use-cases which only require a true/false response.\nThe prompts in the fine-tuning dataset are formatted as follows:\nTrue or false - {statement}\nThe model will then, theoretically, respond with only a single word.\nSQL queries\nGenerating SQL queries given a table definition.\nFor example:\nUsing the context provided, please generate a SQL query to answer the question.\nContext: CREATE TABLE table_name_64 (attendance INTEGER, venue VARCHAR, date VARCHAR)\nQuestion: Which Attendance is the lowest one that has a Venue of away, and a Date of 19?\nResponse:\nSELECT MIN(attendance) FROM table_name_64 WHERE venue = \"away\" AND date = 19\nEmotion detection\nYou can produce Valence-Arousal-Dominance scores for a given input text, which can in turn be mapped to human emotions (e.g. with k-means clustering on V and A)\nExample prompt:\nPlease assign a Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) score in JSON format to the following message:\nShe chronicled her experiences making drug deliveries for gang leaders at age 13 and how she was given her first gun as a birthday present when she was 14.\nResponse:\n{\n\"V\": \"2.7\",\n\"A\": \"3.1\",\n\"D\": \"3.2\"\n}\nMulti-character chat director\nSelect which NPC should speak next.\nThe scope of the entire multi-NPC chat mechanism is a bit too large to include here, but essentially you want separate prompts for each character, as well as a \"director\" prompt which selects which NPC should speak next.\nSystem prompt:\nYou are a director responsible for selecting the next character to speak, and nothing else.  Select from the following characters:\n[\n\"Rachel\",\n\"Aria\",\n\"Jerry\"\n]\nFirst round instruction, i.e. selecting who should speak first:\n[characters]\nname: Rachel\n...\nname: Aria\n...\nname: Jerry\n...\n[/characters]\n[scenario]\n{describe a scenario for the chat}\n[/scenario]\nResponse for the first round:\nAria\nNow, you'd prompt the model for a response from Aria.\nAfterwards, you'd add Aria's response to the \"director\" prompt to see who speaks next, e.g.:\n...\n[/characters]\n[scenario]\nIn a tense situation, Aria informs the group that they will soon be loaded into a cargo plane's unpressurized hold, with a drug to lower their heart rates to increase their chances of survival. As the drug takes effect, Rachel and Jerry share a moment of calm, with Jerry asking Rachel to share something personal. She reveals her ex-husband is in a correctional facility for mail fraud and shares a story about her son Kyle, who plays the trumpet and whose birthday is coming up. Jerry reassures her that they will get through their ordeal. As Rachel starts to lose consciousness, she tries to communicate Aria's instructions to Jerry before they both black out.\n[/scenario]\n[/INST] Aria </s><s>[INST] Aria: \"You'll soon be loaded into the unpressurized hold of a cargo plane. The drug will lower your heartrate to 15 beats per minutes, reducing your need for oxygen... based on your medical records you have a 92% chance of survival.\" Our eyes go wide.

The audio was encoded by a freezed whisper-tiny model. The architecture of the generation network was borrowed from the UNet of the stable-diffusion-v1-4, where the audio embeddings were fused to the image embeddings by cross-attention.\nCases\nMuseV + MuseTalk make human photos alive！\nImage\nMuseV\n+MuseTalk\nThe character of the last two rows, Xinying Sun, is a supermodel KOL.

Then build environment as follows:\npip install -r requirements.txt\nwhisper\ninstall whisper to extract audio feature (only encoder)\npip install --editable ./musetalk/whisper\nmmlab packages\npip install --no-cache-dir -U openmim\nmim install mmengine\nmim install \"mmcv>=2.0.1\"\nmim install \"mmdet>=3.1.0\"\nmim install \"mmpose>=1.1.0\"\nDownload ffmpeg-static\nDownload the ffmpeg-static and\nexport FFMPEG_PATH=/path/to/ffmpeg\nfor example:\nexport FFMPEG_PATH=/musetalk/ffmpeg-4.4-amd64-static\nDownload weights\nYou can download weights manually as follows:\nDownload our trained weights.\nDownload the weights of other components:\nsd-vae-ft-mse\nwhisper\ndwpose\nface-parse-bisent\nresnet18\nFinally, these weights should be organized in models as follows:\n./models/\n├── musetalk\n│   └── musetalk.json\n│   └── pytorch_model.bin\n├── dwpose\n│   └── dw-ll_ucoco_384.pth\n├── face-parse-bisent\n│   ├── 79999_iter.pth\n│   └── resnet18-5c106cde.pth\n├── sd-vae-ft-mse\n│   ├── config.json\n│   └── diffusion_pytorch_model.bin\n└── whisper\n└── tiny.pt\nQuickstart\nInference\nHere, we provide the inference script.\npython -m scripts.inference --inference_config configs/inference/test.yaml\nconfigs/inference/test.yaml is the path to the inference configuration file, including video_path and audio_path.\nThe video_path should be either a video file or a directory of images.\nUse of bbox_shift to have adjustable results\n:mag_right: We have found that upper-bound of the mask has an important impact on mouth openness. Thus, to control the mask region, we suggest using the bbox_shift parameter. Positive values (moving towards the lower half) increase mouth openness, while negative values (moving towards the upper half) decrease mouth openness.\nYou can start by running with the default configuration to obtain the adjustable value range, and then re-run the script within this range.\nFor example, in the case of Xinying Sun, after running the default configuration, it shows that the adjustable value rage is [-9, 9]. Then, to decrease the mouth openness, we set the value to be -7.\npython -m scripts.inference --inference_config configs/inference/test.yaml --bbox_shift -7\n:pushpin: More technical details can be found in bbox_shift.\nCombining MuseV and MuseTalk\nAs a complete solution to virtual human generation, you are suggested to first apply MuseV to generate a video (text-to-video, image-to-video or pose-to-video) by referring this. Then, you can use MuseTalk to generate a lip-sync video by referring this.\nNote\nIf you want to launch online video chats, you are suggested to generate videos using MuseV and apply necessary pre-processing such as face detection in advance. During online chatting, only UNet and the VAE decoder are involved, which makes MuseTalk real-time.\nAcknowledgement\nWe thank open-source components like whisper, dwpose, face-alignment, face-parsing, S3FD.\nMuseTalk has referred much to diffusers.\nMuseTalk has been built on HDTF datasets.\nThanks for open-sourcing!\nLimitations\nResolution: Though MuseTalk uses a face region size of 256 x 256, which make it better than other open-source methods, it has not yet reached the theoretical resolution bound. We will continue to deal with this problem.If you need higher resolution, you could apply super resolution models such as GFPGAN in combination with MuseTalk.\nIdentity preservation: Some details of the original face are not well preserved, such as mustache, lip shape and color.\nJitter: There exists some jitter as the current pipeline adopts single-frame generation.\nCitation\n@article{musetalk,\ntitle={MuseTalk: Real-Time High Quality Lip Synchorization with Latent Space Inpainting},\nauthor={Zhang, Yue and Liu, Minhao and Chen, Zhaokang and Wu, Bin and He, Yingjie and Zhan, Chao and Zhou, Wenjiang},\njournal={arxiv},\nyear={2024}\n}\nDisclaimer/License\ncode: The code of MuseTalk is released under the MIT License.
