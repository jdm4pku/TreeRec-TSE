TTMs are lightweight\nforecasters, pre-trained on publicly available time series data with various augmentations. TTM provides state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasts and can easily be\nfine-tuned for multi-variate forecasts with just 5% of the training data to be competitive.  Refer to our paper for more details.\nThe current open-source version supports point forecasting use-cases specifically ranging from minutely to hourly resolutions\n(Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour.).\nNote that zeroshot, fine-tuning and inference tasks using TTM can easily be executed in 1 GPU machine or in laptops too!!\nNew updates: TTM-R1 comprises TTM variants pre-trained on 250M public training samples. We have another set of TTM models released recently under TTM-R2 trained on a much larger pretraining\ndataset (~700M samples) which can be accessed from here. In general, TTM-R2 models perform better than\nTTM-R1 models as they are trained on larger pretraining dataset. However, the choice of R1 vs R2 depends on your target data distribution. Hence requesting users to\ntry both R1 and R2 variants and pick the best for your data.\nModel Description\nTTM falls under the category of “focused pre-trained models”, wherein each pre-trained TTM is tailored for a particular forecasting\nsetting (governed by the context length and forecast length). Instead of building one massive model supporting all forecasting settings,\nwe opt for the approach of constructing smaller pre-trained models, each focusing on a specific forecasting setting, thereby\nyielding more accurate results. Furthermore, this approach ensures that our models remain extremely small and exceptionally fast,\nfacilitating easy deployment without demanding a ton of resources.\nHence, in this model card, we plan to release several pre-trained\nTTMs that can cater to many common forecasting settings in practice. Additionally, we have released our source code along with\nour pretraining scripts that users can utilize to pretrain models on their own. Pretraining TTMs is very easy and fast, taking\nonly 3-6 hours using 6 A100 GPUs, as opposed to several days or weeks in traditional approaches.\nEach pre-trained model will be released in a different branch name in this model card. Kindly access the required model using our\ngetting started notebook mentioning the branch name.\nModel Releases (along with the branch name where the models are stored):\n512-96: Given the last 512 time-points (i.e. context length), this model can forecast up to next 96 time-points (i.e. forecast length)\nin future. This model is targeted towards a forecasting setting of context length 512 and forecast length 96 and\nrecommended for hourly and minutely resolutions (Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour, etc). This model refers to the TTM-Q variant used in the paper. (branch name: main) [Benchmark Scripts]\n1024-96: Given the last 1024 time-points (i.e. context length), this model can forecast up to next 96 time-points (i.e. forecast length)\nin future. This model is targeted towards a long forecasting setting of context length 1024 and forecast length 96 and\nrecommended for hourly and minutely resolutions (Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour, etc). (branch name: 1024-96-v1) [Benchmark Scripts]\nWe can also use the [get_model] utility to automatically select the required model based on your input context length and forecast length requirement.\nFor more variants (till forecast length 720), refer to our new model card here\nModel Capabilities with example scripts\nThe below model scripts can be used for any of the above TTM models. Please update the HF model URL and branch name in the from_pretrained call appropriately to pick the model of your choice.\nGetting Started [colab]\nZeroshot Multivariate Forecasting [Example]\nFinetuned Multivariate Forecasting:\nChannel-Independent Finetuning [Example 1] [Example 2]\nChannel-Mix Finetuning [Example]\nNew Releases (extended features released on October 2024)\nFinetuning and Forecasting with Exogenous/Control Variables [Example]\nFinetuning and Forecasting with static categorical features [Example: To be added soon]\nRolling Forecasts - Extend forecast lengths beyond 96 via rolling capability [Example]\nHelper scripts for optimal Learning Rate suggestions for Finetuning [Example]\nBenchmarks\nTTM outperforms popular benchmarks such as TimesFM, Moirai, Chronos, Lag-Llama, Moment, GPT4TS, TimeLLM, LLMTime in zero/fewshot forecasting while reducing computational requirements significantly.\nMoreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider\nadoption in resource-constrained environments. For more details, refer to our paper TTM-Q referred in the paper maps to the 512-96 model\nuploaded in the main branch. For other variants (TTM-B, TTM-E and TTM-A) please refer here. For more details, refer to the paper.\nRecommended Use\nUsers have to externally standard scale their data independently for every channel before feeding it to the model (Refer to TSP, our data processing utility for data scaling.)\nThe current open-source version supports only minutely and hourly resolutions(Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour.). Other lower resolutions (say weekly, or monthly) are currently not supported in this version, as the model needs a minimum context length of 512 or 1024.\nEnabling any upsampling or prepending zeros to virtually increase the context length for shorter-length datasets is not recommended and will\nimpact the model performance.\nModel Details\nFor more details on TTM architecture and benchmarks, refer to our paper.\nTTM-1 currently supports 2 modes:\nZeroshot forecasting: Directly apply the pre-trained model on your target data to get an initial forecast (with no training).\nFinetuned forecasting: Finetune the pre-trained model with a subset of your target data to further improve the forecast.\nSince, TTM models are extremely small and fast, it is practically very easy to finetune the model with your available target data in few minutes\nto get more accurate forecasts.\nThe current release supports multivariate forecasting via both channel independence and channel-mixing approaches.\nDecoder Channel-Mixing can be enabled during fine-tuning for capturing strong channel-correlation patterns across\ntime-series variates, a critical capability lacking in existing counterparts.\nIn addition, TTM also supports exogenous infusion and categorical data infusion.\nModel Sources\nRepository: https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-tsfm/tree/main/tsfm_public/models/tinytimemixer\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03955.pdf\nBlogs and articles on TTM:\nRefer to our wiki\nUses\n# Load Model from HF Model Hub mentioning the branch name in revision field\nmodel = TinyTimeMixerForPrediction.from_pretrained(\n\"https://huggingface.co/ibm/TTM\", revision=\"main\"\n)\n# Do zeroshot\nzeroshot_trainer = Trainer(\nmodel=model,\nargs=zeroshot_forecast_args,\n)\n)\nzeroshot_output = zeroshot_trainer.evaluate(dset_test)\n# Freeze backbone and enable few-shot or finetuning:\n# freeze backbone\nfor param in model.backbone.parameters():\nparam.requires_grad = False\nfinetune_forecast_trainer = Trainer(\nmodel=model,\nargs=finetune_forecast_args,\ntrain_dataset=dset_train,\neval_dataset=dset_val,\ncallbacks=[early_stopping_callback, tracking_callback],\noptimizers=(optimizer, scheduler),\n)\nfinetune_forecast_trainer.train()\nfewshot_output = finetune_forecast_trainer.evaluate(dset_test)\nTraining Data\nThe original r1 TTM models were trained on a collection of datasets from the Monash Time Series Forecasting repository.

Since this model is pretty small, I recommend Q8_0, if not f16/32. Generally, the lower you go in the list (or the bigger the number gets), the larger the file and the better the performance.\nYou will see a green checkmark and the word \"Downloaded\" once the model has successfully downloaded, which can take some time depending on your network speeds.\nOnce this model is finished downloading, navigate to the \"Local Server\" tab on the left menu and open the loader for text embedding models. This loader does not appear before version 0.2.19, so ensure you downloaded the correct version.\nSelect the model you just downloaded from the dropdown that appears to load it.

To do this, you'll need to figure out how much RAM and/or VRAM you have.\nIf you want your model running as FAST as possible, you'll want to fit the whole thing on your GPU's VRAM. Aim for a quant with a file size 1-2GB smaller than your GPU's total VRAM.\nIf you want the absolute maximum quality, add both your system RAM and your GPU's VRAM together, then similarly grab a quant with a file size 1-2GB Smaller than that total.\nNext, you'll need to decide if you want to use an 'I-quant' or a 'K-quant'.\nIf you don't want to think too much, grab one of the K-quants. These are in format 'QX_K_X', like Q5_K_M.\nIf you want to get more into the weeds, you can check out this extremely useful feature chart:\nllama.cpp feature matrix\nBut basically, if you're aiming for below Q4, and you're running cuBLAS (Nvidia) or rocBLAS (AMD), you should look towards the I-quants. These are in format IQX_X, like IQ3_M. These are newer and offer better performance for their size.\nThese I-quants can also be used on CPU and Apple Metal, but will be slower than their K-quant equivalent, so speed vs performance is a tradeoff you'll have to decide.\nThe I-quants are not compatible with Vulcan, which is also AMD, so if you have an AMD card double check if you're using the rocBLAS build or the Vulcan build. At the time of writing this, LM Studio has a preview with ROCm support, and other inference engines have specific builds for ROCm.\nWant to support my work?

The releases are state-of-the-art for Retrieval quality at each of their representative size profiles. Technical Report is coming shortly. For more details, please refer to our Github: Arctic-Text-Embed.\nModels\nsnowflake-arctic-embed is a suite of text embedding models that focuses on creating high-quality retrieval models optimized for performance.\nThe snowflake-arctic-embedding models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MTEB/BEIR leaderboard for each of their size variants. Evaluation is performed using these scripts. As shown below, each class of model size achieves SOTA retrieval accuracy compared to other top models.\nThe models are trained by leveraging existing open-source text representation models, such as bert-base-uncased, and are trained in a multi-stage pipeline to optimize their retrieval performance. First, the models are trained with large batches of query-document pairs where negatives are derived in-batch—pretraining leverages about 400m samples of a mix of public datasets and proprietary web search data. Following pretraining models are further optimized with long training on a smaller dataset (about 1m samples) of triplets of query, positive document, and negative document derived from hard harmful mining. Mining of the negatives and data curation is crucial to retrieval accuracy.

To do this, you'll need to figure out how much RAM and/or VRAM you have.\nIf you want your model running as FAST as possible, you'll want to fit the whole thing on your GPU's VRAM. Aim for a quant with a file size 1-2GB smaller than your GPU's total VRAM.\nIf you want the absolute maximum quality, add both your system RAM and your GPU's VRAM together, then similarly grab a quant with a file size 1-2GB Smaller than that total.\nNext, you'll need to decide if you want to use an 'I-quant' or a 'K-quant'.\nIf you don't want to think too much, grab one of the K-quants. These are in format 'QX_K_X', like Q5_K_M.\nIf you want to get more into the weeds, you can check out this extremely useful feature chart:\nllama.cpp feature matrix\nBut basically, if you're aiming for below Q4, and you're running cuBLAS (Nvidia) or rocBLAS (AMD), you should look towards the I-quants. These are in format IQX_X, like IQ3_M. These are newer and offer better performance for their size.\nThese I-quants can also be used on CPU and Apple Metal, but will be slower than their K-quant equivalent, so speed vs performance is a tradeoff you'll have to decide.\nThe I-quants are not compatible with Vulcan, which is also AMD, so if you have an AMD card double check if you're using the rocBLAS build or the Vulcan build. At the time of writing this, LM Studio has a preview with ROCm support, and other inference engines have specific builds for ROCm.\nWant to support my work?

To run the model, first\ninstall the latest version of Transformers.\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --upgrade transformers accelerate\nShort-Form Transcription\nThe model can be used with the pipeline\nclass to transcribe short-form audio files (< 30-seconds) as follows:\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n# config\nmodel_id = \"kotoba-tech/kotoba-whisper-v1.0\"\ntorch_dtype = torch.bfloat16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32\ndevice = \"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\nmodel_kwargs = {\"attn_implementation\": \"sdpa\"} if torch.cuda.is_available() else {}\ngenerate_kwargs = {\"language\": \"ja\", \"task\": \"transcribe\"}\n# load model\npipe = pipeline(\n\"automatic-speech-recognition\",\nmodel=model_id,\ntorch_dtype=torch_dtype,\ndevice=device,\nmodel_kwargs=model_kwargs\n)\n# load sample audio\ndataset = load_dataset(\"japanese-asr/ja_asr.reazonspeech_test\", split=\"test\")\nsample = dataset[0][\"audio\"]\n# run inference\nresult = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs=generate_kwargs)\nprint(result[\"text\"])\nTo transcribe a local audio file, simply pass the path to your audio file when you call the pipeline (make sure the audio is sampled in 16kHz):\n- result = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs=generate_kwargs)\n+ result = pipe(\"audio.mp3\", generate_kwargs=generate_kwargs)\nFor segment-level timestamps, pass the argument return_timestamps=True and return the \"chunks\" output:\nresult = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=True, generate_kwargs=generate_kwargs)\nprint(result[\"chunks\"])\nSequential Long-Form: Kotoba-whisper is designed to be compatible with OpenAI's sequential long-form transcription algorithm. This algorithm uses a sliding window for buffered\ninference of long audio files (> 30-seconds), and returns more accurate transcriptions compared to the chunked long-form algorithm.\nAs default, if long audio files are passed to the model, it will transcribes with the sequential long-form transcription.\nThe sequential long-form algorithm should be used in either of the following scenarios:\nTranscription accuracy is the most important factor, and latency is less of a consideration\nYou are transcribing batches of long audio files, in which case the latency of sequential is comparable to chunked, while being up to 0.5% WER more accurate\nIf you are transcribing single long audio files and latency is the most important factor, you should use the chunked algorithm\ndescribed below. For a detailed explanation of the different algorithms, refer to Sections 5 of\nthe Distil-Whisper paper. The pipeline\nclass can be used to transcribe long audio files with the sequential algorithm as follows:\nChunked Long-Form\nThis algorithm should be used when a single large audio file is being transcribed and the fastest possible inference is required. In such circumstances,\nthe chunked algorithm is up to 9x faster than OpenAI's sequential long-form implementation (see Table 7 of the Distil-Whisper paper).\nTo enable chunking, pass the chunk_length_s parameter to the pipeline. For distil-large-v3, a chunk length of 25-seconds\nis optimal.

For more technical information about generation parameters and recipes for how to use Llama 3 in applications, please go here.\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases Llama 3 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Instruction tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\nOut-of-scope Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3 Community License. Use in languages other than English**.\n**Note: Developers may fine-tune Llama 3 models for languages beyond English provided they comply with the Llama 3 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy.\nHow to use\nThis repository contains two versions of Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, for use with transformers and with the original llama3 codebase.\nUse with transformers\nSee the snippet below for usage with Transformers:\n>>> import transformers\n>>> import torch\n>>> model_id = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B\"\n>>> pipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n\"text-generation\", model=model_id, model_kwargs={\"torch_dtype\": torch.bfloat16}, device_map=\"auto\"\n)\n>>> pipeline(\"Hey how are you doing today?\")\nUse with llama3\nPlease, follow the instructions in the repository.\nTo download Original checkpoints, see the example command below leveraging huggingface-cli:\nhuggingface-cli download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B --include \"original/*\" --local-dir Meta-Llama-3-70B\nFor Hugging Face support, we recommend using transformers or TGI, but a similar command works.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research SuperCluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\nCarbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 7.7M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type H100-80GB (TDP of 700W). Estimated total emissions were 2290 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\nTime (GPU hours)\nPower Consumption (W)\nCarbon Emitted(tCO2eq)\nLlama 3 8B\n1.3M\n700\n390\nLlama 3 70B\n6.4M\n700\n1900\nTotal\n7.7M\n2290\nCO2 emissions during pre-training. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview Llama 3 was pretrained on over 15 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over 10M human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\nData Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of March 2023 for the 7B and December 2023 for the 70B models respectively.\nBenchmarks\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 3 models on standard automatic benchmarks. For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.

We are committed to Responsible AI development and took a series of steps to limit misuse and harm and support the open source community.\nFoundation models are widely capable technologies that are built to be used for a diverse range of applications. They are not designed to meet every developer preference on safety levels for all use cases, out-of-the-box, as those by their nature will differ across different applications.\nRather, responsible LLM-application deployment is achieved by implementing a series of safety best practices throughout the development of such applications, from the model pre-training, fine-tuning and the deployment of systems composed of safeguards to tailor the safety needs specifically to the use case and audience.\nAs part of the Llama 3 release, we updated our Responsible Use Guide to outline the steps and best practices for developers to implement model and system level safety for their application. We also provide a set of resources including Meta Llama Guard 2 and Code Shield safeguards. These tools have proven to drastically reduce residual risks of LLM Systems, while maintaining a high level of helpfulness. We encourage developers to tune and deploy these safeguards according to their needs and we provide a reference implementation to get you started.\nLlama 3-Instruct\nAs outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, some trade-off between model helpfulness and model alignment is likely unavoidable. Developers should exercise discretion about how to weigh the benefits of alignment and helpfulness for their specific use case and audience. Developers should be mindful of residual risks when using Llama models and leverage additional safety tools as needed to reach the right safety bar for their use case.\nSafety\nFor our instruction tuned model, we conducted extensive red teaming exercises, performed adversarial evaluations and implemented safety mitigations techniques to lower residual risks. As with any Large Language Model, residual risks will likely remain and we recommend that developers assess these risks in the context of their use case. In parallel, we are working with the community to make AI safety benchmark standards transparent, rigorous and interpretable.\nRefusals\nIn addition to residual risks, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts. Over-refusing not only can impact the user experience but could even be harmful in certain contexts as well. We’ve heard the feedback from the developer community and improved our fine tuning to ensure that Llama 3 is significantly less likely to falsely refuse to answer prompts than Llama 2.\nWe built internal benchmarks and developed mitigations to limit false refusals making Llama 3 our most helpful model to date.\nResponsible release\nIn addition to responsible use considerations outlined above, we followed a rigorous process that requires us to take extra measures against misuse and critical risks before we make our release decision.\nMisuse\nIf you access or use Llama 3, you agree to the Acceptable Use Policy. The most recent copy of this policy can be found at https://llama.meta.com/llama3/use-policy/.\nCritical risks\nCBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives)\nWe have conducted a two fold assessment of the safety of the model in this area:\nIterative testing during model training to assess the safety of responses related to CBRNE threats and other adversarial risks.\nInvolving external CBRNE experts to conduct an uplift test assessing the ability of the model to accurately provide expert knowledge and reduce barriers to potential CBRNE misuse, by reference to what can be achieved using web search (without the model).\nCyber Security\nWe have evaluated Llama 3 with CyberSecEval, Meta’s cybersecurity safety eval suite, measuring Llama 3’s propensity to suggest insecure code when used as a coding assistant, and Llama 3’s propensity to comply with requests to help carry out cyber attacks, where attacks are defined by the industry standard MITRE ATT&CK cyber attack ontology. On our insecure coding and cyber attacker helpfulness tests, Llama 3 behaved in the same range or safer than models of equivalent coding capability.\nChild Safety\nChild Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development.  For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\nCommunity\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership in AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nThe core values of Llama 3 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nBut Llama 3 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. As outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, we recommend incorporating Purple Llama solutions into your workflows and specifically Llama Guard which provides a base model to filter input and output prompts to layer system-level safety on top of model-level safety.\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at http://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide\nCitation instructions\n@article{llama3modelcard,\ntitle={Llama 3 Model Card},\nauthor={AI@Meta},\nyear={2024},\nurl = {https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md}\n}\nContributors\nAaditya Singh;

Similar to Llama Guard, it can be used for classifying content in both LLM inputs (prompt classification) and in LLM responses (response classification). It acts as an LLM – it generates text in its output that indicates whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe, and if unsafe, it also lists the content categories violated.\nBelow is a response classification example input and output for Llama Guard 2.\nIn order to produce classifier scores, we look at the probability for the first token, and use that as the “unsafe” class probability. We can then apply score thresholding to make binary decisions.\nHarm Taxonomy and Policy\nThe model is trained to predict safety labels on the 11 categories shown below, based on the MLCommons taxonomy of hazards.\nHarm categories\nS1: Violent Crimes\nS2: Non-Violent Crimes\nS3: Sex-Related Crimes\nS4: Child Sexual Exploitation\nS5: Specialized Advice\nS6: Privacy\nS7: Intellectual Property\nS8: Indiscriminate Weapons\nS9: Hate\nS10: Suicide & Self-Harm\nS11: Sexual Content\nS1: Violent Crimes\nResponses that enable, encourage, or endorse the commission of violent crimes, including: (1) unlawful violence toward people (ex: terrorism, genocide, murder, hate-motivated violent crimes, child abuse, assault, battery, kidnapping) and (2) unlawful violence toward animals (ex: animal abuse)\nS2: Non-Violent Crimes\nResponses that enable, encourage, or endorse the commission of non-violent crimes, including: (1) personal crimes (ex: labor trafficking, threats, intimidation, hate-motivated non-violent crimes), (2) financial crimes (ex: fraud, scams, money laundering), (3) property crimes (ex: theft, arson, vandalism), (4) drug crimes (ex: creating or using regulated substances), (5) weapons crimes (ex: producing unlicensed firearms), and (6) cyber crimes (ex: hacking)\nS3: Sex-Related Crimes\nResponses that enable, encourage, or endorse the commission of sex-related crimes, including: (1) sex trafficking, (2) sexual assault (ex: rape), (3) sexual harassment (physical, verbal, or visual), and (4) prostitution\nS4: Child Sexual Exploitation\nResponses that contain, describe, enable, encourage, or endorse the sexual abuse of children\nS5: Specialized Advice\nResponses that contain specialized financial, medical, or legal advice, or that indicate dangerous activities or objects are safe\nS6: Privacy\nResponses that contain sensitive, nonpublic personal information that could undermine someone's physical, digital, or financial security\nS7: Intellectual Property\nResponses that may violate the intellectual property rights of any third party\nS8: Indiscriminate Weapons\nResponses that enable, encourage, or endorse the creation of indiscriminate weapons, including: (1) chemical weapons (ex: nerve gas), (2) biological weapons (ex: anthrax), (3) radiological weapons (ex: cobalt bombs), (4) nuclear weapons (ex: fission bombs), and (5) high-yield explosive weapons (ex: cluster munitions)\nS9: Hate\nResponses that demean or dehumanize people on the basis of their sensitive, personal characteristics (i.e., race, color, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and/or serious disease)\nS10: Suicide & Self-Harm\nResponses that enable, encourage, or endorse acts of intentional self-harm, including: (1) suicide, (2) self-injury (ex: cutting), and (3) disordered eating\nS11: Sexual Content\nResponses that contain erotica\nHow to Use in transformers\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-Guard-2-8B\"\ndevice = \"cuda\"\ndtype = torch.bfloat16\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=dtype, device_map=device)\ndef moderate(chat):\ninput_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)\noutput = model.generate(input_ids=input_ids, max_new_tokens=100, pad_token_id=0)\nprompt_len = input_ids.shape[-1]\nreturn tokenizer.decode(output[0][prompt_len:], skip_special_tokens=True)\nmoderate([\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I forgot how to kill a process in Linux, can you help?\"},\n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Sure! To kill a process in Linux, you can use the kill command followed by the process ID (PID) of the process you want to terminate.\"},\n])\n# `safe`\nTraining and Evaluation Data\nWe start with the training set of Llama Guard (see model card), and obtain labels on the Harm Taxonomy described above. To improve adaptability of the model to different prompts, we train on hard samples, which are obtained by taking an existing sample and prompting Llama2 70B to produce an alternate policy description that will flip the label of the given sample.\nWe report metrics for various models and APIs on our validation set, which is obtained from combining the validation set of Llama Guard v1 and held-out samples from the additional Llama 3 safety data.\nWe compare performance on our internal test set, as well as on open datasets like XSTest, OpenAI moderation, and BeaverTails.\nWe find that there is overlap between our training set and the BeaverTails-30k test split. Since both our internal test set and BeaverTails use prompts from the Anthropic's hh-rlhf dataset as a starting point for curating data, it is possible that different splits of Anthropic were used while creating the two datasets. Therefore to prevent leakage of signal between our train set and the BeaverTails-30k test set, we create our own BeaverTails-30k splits based on the Anthropic train-test splits used for creating our internal sets.\nNote on evaluations: As discussed in the Llama Guard paper, comparing model performance is not straightforward as each model is built on its own policy and is expected to perform better on an evaluation dataset with a policy aligned to the model. This highlights the need for industry standards. By aligning Llama Guard 2 with the Proof of Concept MLCommons taxonomy, we hope to drive adoption of industry standards like this and facilitate collaboration and transparency in the LLM safety and content evaluation space.\nModel Performance\nWe evaluate the performance of Llama Guard 2 and compare it with Llama Guard and popular content moderation APIs such as Azure, OpenAI Moderation, and Perspective. We use the token probability of the first output token (i.e. safe/unsafe) as the score for classification. For obtaining a binary classification decision from the score, we use a threshold of 0.5.\nLlama Guard 2 improves over Llama Guard, and outperforms other approaches on our internal test set. Note that we manage to achieve great performance while keeping a low false positive rate as we know that over-moderation can impact user experience when building LLM-applications.\nModel\nF1 ↑\nAUPRC ↑\nFalse PositiveRate ↓\nLlama Guard*\n0.665\n0.854\n0.027\nLlama Guard 2\n0.915\n0.974\n0.040\nGPT4\n0.796\nN/A\n0.151\nOpenAI Moderation API\n0.347\n0.669\n0.030\nAzure Content Safety API\n0.519\nN/A\n0.245\nPerspective API\n0.265\n0.586\n0.046\nTable 1: Comparison of performance of various approaches measured on our internal test set.\n*The performance of Llama Guard is lower on our new test set due to expansion of the number of harm categories from 6 to 11, which is not aligned to what Llama Guard was trained on.\nCategory\nFalse Negative Rate* ↓\nFalse Positive Rate ↓\nViolent Crimes\n0.042\n0.002\nPrivacy\n0.057\n0.004\nNon-Violent Crimes\n0.082\n0.009\nIntellectual Property\n0.099\n0.004\nHate\n0.190\n0.005\nSpecialized Advice\n0.192\n0.009\nSexual Content\n0.229\n0.004\nIndiscriminate Weapons\n0.263\n0.001\nChild Exploitation\n0.267\n0.000\nSex Crimes\n0.275\n0.002\nSelf-Harm\n0.277\n0.002\nTable 2: Category-wise breakdown of false negative rate and false positive rate for Llama Guard 2 on our internal benchmark for response classification with safety labels from the ML Commons taxonomy.*The binary safe/unsafe label is used to compute categorical FNR by using the true categories. We do not penalize the model while computing FNR for cases where the model predicts the correct overall label but an incorrect categorical label.\nWe also report performance on OSS safety datasets, though we note that the policy used for assigning safety labels is not aligned with the policy used while training Llama Guard 2. Still, Llama Guard 2 provides a superior tradeoff between f1 score and False Positive Rate on the XSTest and OpenAI Moderation datasets, demonstrating good adaptability to other policies.\nThe BeaverTails dataset has a lower bar for a sample to be considered unsafe compared to Llama Guard 2's policy. The policy and training data of MDJudge [4] is more aligned with this dataset and we see that it performs better on them as expected (at the cost of a higher FPR). GPT-4 achieves high recall on all of the sets but at the cost of very high FPR (9-25%), which could hurt its ability to be used as a safeguard for practical applications.\n(F1 ↑ / False Positive Rate ↓)\nFalse Refusals(XSTest)\nOpenAI policy(OpenAI Mod)\nBeaverTails policy(BeaverTails-30k)\nLlama Guard\n0.737 / 0.079\n0.737 / 0.079\n0.599 / 0.035\nLlama Guard 2\n0.884 / 0.084\n0.807 / 0.060\n0.736 / 0.059\nMDJudge\n0.856 / 0.172\n0.768 / 0.212\n0.849 / 0.098\nGPT4\n0.895 / 0.128\n0.842 / 0.092\n0.802 / 0.256\nOpenAI Mod API\n0.576 / 0.040\n0.788 / 0.156\n0.284 / 0.056\nTable 3: Comparison of performance of various approaches measured on our internal test set for response classification. NOTE: The policy used for training Llama Guard does not align with those used for labeling these datasets. Still, Llama Guard 2 provides a superior tradeoff between F1 score and False Positive Rate across these datasets, demonstrating strong adaptability to other policies.\nWe hope to provide developers with a high-performing moderation solution for most use cases by aligning Llama Guard 2 taxonomy with MLCommons standard. But as outlined in our Responsible Use Guide, each use case requires specific safety considerations and we encourage developers to tune Llama Guard 2 for their own use case to achieve better moderation for their custom policies. As an example of how Llama Guard 2's performance may change, we train on the BeaverTails training dataset and compare against MDJudge (which was trained on BeaverTails among others).\nModel\nF1 ↑\nFalse Positive Rate ↓\nLlama Guard 2\n0.736\n0.059\nMDJudge\n0.849\n0.098\nLlama Guard 2 + BeaverTails\n0.852\n0.101\nTable 4: Comparison of performance on BeaverTails-30k.\nLimitations\nThere are some limitations associated with Llama Guard 2. First, Llama Guard 2 itself is an LLM fine-tuned on Llama 3. Thus, its performance (e.g., judgments that need common sense knowledge, multilingual capability, and policy coverage) might be limited by its (pre-)training data.\nSecond, Llama Guard 2 is finetuned for safety classification only (i.e. to generate \"safe\" or \"unsafe\"), and is not designed for chat use cases. However, since it is an LLM, it can still be prompted with any text to obtain a completion.\nLastly, as an LLM, Llama Guard 2 may be susceptible to adversarial attacks or prompt injection attacks that could bypass or alter its intended use. However, with the help of external components (e.g., KNN, perplexity filter), recent work (e.g., [3]) demonstrates that Llama Guard is able to detect harmful content reliably.\nNote on Llama Guard 2's policy\nLlama Guard 2 supports 11 out of the 13 categories included in the MLCommons AI Safety taxonomy. The Election and Defamation categories are not addressed by Llama Guard 2 as moderating these harm categories requires access to up-to-date, factual information sources and the ability to determine the veracity of a particular output. To support the additional categories, we recommend using other solutions (e.g. Retrieval Augmented Generation) in tandem with Llama Guard 2 to evaluate information correctness.\nCitation\n@misc{metallamaguard2,\nauthor =       {Llama Team},\ntitle =        {Meta Llama Guard 2},\nhowpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama/blob/main/Llama-Guard2/MODEL_CARD.md}},\nyear =         {2024}\n}\nReferences\n[1] Llama 3 Model Card\n[2] Llama Guard Model Card\n[3] RigorLLM: Resilient Guardrails for Large Language Models against Undesired Content\n[4] MDJudge for Salad-Bench",

with an assistive model by passing a smaller model through the assistant_model argument, for example:\npython generate_openelm.py --model [MODEL_NAME] --hf_access_token [HF_ACCESS_TOKEN] --prompt 'Once upon a time there was' --generate_kwargs repetition_penalty=1.2 --assistant_model [SMALLER_MODEL_NAME]\nMain Results\nZero-Shot\nModel

Limitations\nThe release of OpenELM models aims to empower and enrich the open research community by providing access to state-of-the-art language models. Trained on publicly available datasets, these models are made available without any safety guarantees. Consequently, there exists the possibility of these models producing outputs that are inaccurate, harmful, biased, or objectionable in response to user prompts. Thus, it is imperative for users and developers to undertake thorough safety testing and implement appropriate filtering mechanisms tailored to their specific requirements.\nCitation\nIf you find our work useful, please cite:\n@article{mehtaOpenELMEfficientLanguage2024,\ntitle = {{OpenELM}: {An} {Efficient} {Language} {Model} {Family} with {Open} {Training} and {Inference} {Framework}},\nshorttitle = {{OpenELM}},\nurl = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14619v1},\nlanguage = {en},\nurldate = {2024-04-24},\njournal = {arXiv.org},\nauthor = {Mehta, Sachin and Sekhavat, Mohammad Hossein and Cao, Qingqing and Horton, Maxwell and Jin, Yanzi and Sun, Chenfan and Mirzadeh, Iman and Najibi, Mahyar and Belenko, Dmitry and Zatloukal, Peter and Rastegari, Mohammad},\nmonth = apr,\nyear = {2024},\n}\n@inproceedings{mehta2022cvnets,\nauthor = {Mehta, Sachin and Abdolhosseini, Farzad and Rastegari, Mohammad},\ntitle = {CVNets: High Performance Library for Computer Vision},\nyear = {2022},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Multimedia},\nseries = {MM '22}\n}",

For more technical information about generation parameters and recipes for how to use Llama 3 in applications, please go here.\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases Llama 3 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Instruction tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\nOut-of-scope Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3 Community License. Use in languages other than English**.\n**Note: Developers may fine-tune Llama 3 models for languages beyond English provided they comply with the Llama 3 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy.\nHow to use\nThis repository contains two versions of Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, for use with transformers and with the original llama3 codebase.\nUse with transformers\nYou can run conversational inference using the Transformers pipeline abstraction, or by leveraging the Auto classes with the generate() function. Let's see examples of both.\nTransformers pipeline\nimport transformers\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\"\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n\"text-generation\",\nmodel=model_id,\nmodel_kwargs={\"torch_dtype\": torch.bfloat16},\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\n)\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak!\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who are you?\"},\n]\nterminators = [\npipeline.tokenizer.eos_token_id,\npipeline.tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(\"<|eot_id|>\")\n]\noutputs = pipeline(\nmessages,\nmax_new_tokens=256,\neos_token_id=terminators,\ndo_sample=True,\ntemperature=0.6,\ntop_p=0.9,\n)\nprint(outputs[0][\"generated_text\"][-1])\nTransformers AutoModelForCausalLM\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\nmodel_id,\ntorch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\ndevice_map=\"auto\",\n)\nmessages = [\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak!\"},\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who are you?\"},\n]\ninput_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\nmessages,\nadd_generation_prompt=True,\nreturn_tensors=\"pt\"\n).to(model.device)\nterminators = [\ntokenizer.eos_token_id,\ntokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(\"<|eot_id|>\")\n]\noutputs = model.generate(\ninput_ids,\nmax_new_tokens=256,\neos_token_id=terminators,\ndo_sample=True,\ntemperature=0.6,\ntop_p=0.9,\n)\nresponse = outputs[0][input_ids.shape[-1]:]\nprint(tokenizer.decode(response, skip_special_tokens=True))\nUse with llama3\nPlease, follow the instructions in the repository\nTo download Original checkpoints, see the example command below leveraging huggingface-cli:\nhuggingface-cli download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct --include \"original/*\" --local-dir Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\nFor Hugging Face support, we recommend using transformers or TGI, but a similar command works.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research SuperCluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\nCarbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 7.7M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type H100-80GB (TDP of 700W). Estimated total emissions were 2290 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\nTime (GPU hours)\nPower Consumption (W)\nCarbon Emitted(tCO2eq)\nLlama 3 8B\n1.3M\n700\n390\nLlama 3 70B\n6.4M\n700\n1900\nTotal\n7.7M\n2290\nCO2 emissions during pre-training. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview Llama 3 was pretrained on over 15 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over 10M human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\nData Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of March 2023 for the 8B and December 2023 for the 70B models respectively.\nBenchmarks\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 3 models on standard automatic benchmarks. For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.

We are committed to Responsible AI development and took a series of steps to limit misuse and harm and support the open source community.\nFoundation models are widely capable technologies that are built to be used for a diverse range of applications. They are not designed to meet every developer preference on safety levels for all use cases, out-of-the-box, as those by their nature will differ across different applications.\nRather, responsible LLM-application deployment is achieved by implementing a series of safety best practices throughout the development of such applications, from the model pre-training, fine-tuning and the deployment of systems composed of safeguards to tailor the safety needs specifically to the use case and audience.\nAs part of the Llama 3 release, we updated our Responsible Use Guide to outline the steps and best practices for developers to implement model and system level safety for their application. We also provide a set of resources including Meta Llama Guard 2 and Code Shield safeguards. These tools have proven to drastically reduce residual risks of LLM Systems, while maintaining a high level of helpfulness. We encourage developers to tune and deploy these safeguards according to their needs and we provide a reference implementation to get you started.\nLlama 3-Instruct\nAs outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, some trade-off between model helpfulness and model alignment is likely unavoidable. Developers should exercise discretion about how to weigh the benefits of alignment and helpfulness for their specific use case and audience. Developers should be mindful of residual risks when using Llama models and leverage additional safety tools as needed to reach the right safety bar for their use case.\nSafety\nFor our instruction tuned model, we conducted extensive red teaming exercises, performed adversarial evaluations and implemented safety mitigations techniques to lower residual risks. As with any Large Language Model, residual risks will likely remain and we recommend that developers assess these risks in the context of their use case. In parallel, we are working with the community to make AI safety benchmark standards transparent, rigorous and interpretable.\nRefusals\nIn addition to residual risks, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts. Over-refusing not only can impact the user experience but could even be harmful in certain contexts as well. We’ve heard the feedback from the developer community and improved our fine tuning to ensure that Llama 3 is significantly less likely to falsely refuse to answer prompts than Llama 2.\nWe built internal benchmarks and developed mitigations to limit false refusals making Llama 3 our most helpful model to date.\nResponsible release\nIn addition to responsible use considerations outlined above, we followed a rigorous process that requires us to take extra measures against misuse and critical risks before we make our release decision.\nMisuse\nIf you access or use Llama 3, you agree to the Acceptable Use Policy. The most recent copy of this policy can be found at https://llama.meta.com/llama3/use-policy/.\nCritical risks\nCBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives)\nWe have conducted a two fold assessment of the safety of the model in this area:\nIterative testing during model training to assess the safety of responses related to CBRNE threats and other adversarial risks.\nInvolving external CBRNE experts to conduct an uplift test assessing the ability of the model to accurately provide expert knowledge and reduce barriers to potential CBRNE misuse, by reference to what can be achieved using web search (without the model).\nCyber Security\nWe have evaluated Llama 3 with CyberSecEval, Meta’s cybersecurity safety eval suite, measuring Llama 3’s propensity to suggest insecure code when used as a coding assistant, and Llama 3’s propensity to comply with requests to help carry out cyber attacks, where attacks are defined by the industry standard MITRE ATT&CK cyber attack ontology. On our insecure coding and cyber attacker helpfulness tests, Llama 3 behaved in the same range or safer than models of equivalent coding capability.\nChild Safety\nChild Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development.  For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\nCommunity\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership in AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our Github repository.\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an output reporting mechanism and bug bounty program to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nThe core values of Llama 3 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\nBut Llama 3 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. As outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, we recommend incorporating Purple Llama solutions into your workflows and specifically Llama Guard which provides a base model to filter input and output prompts to layer system-level safety on top of model-level safety.\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at http://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide\nCitation instructions\n@article{llama3modelcard,\ntitle={Llama 3 Model Card},\nauthor={AI@Meta},\nyear={2024},\nurl = {https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md}\n}\nContributors\nAaditya Singh;

Дано: Таня, мяч\nSaiga: В небольшой деревушке под открытым небом жила девочка по имени Таня. Она была очень активной и любящей играть в различные виды спорта. Однажды, когда она прогуливалась по полям, увидела на земле лежащий мяч. Это был старый, но все еще пригодный для игры мячик.\nТаня сразу же решила взять его себе домой и показать своему другу Мише. Мишка тоже обожал футбол и всегда рад был бы провести время вместе со своими друзьями. Когда они вернулись домой, Таня показала ему найденный мячик и предложила сыграть в футбол.\nМишка был счастлив, что у них появился новый мяч, и они сразу же начали готовиться к матчу. Они построили две команды и начали игру. Играли они до вечера, а потом решили сделать перерыв и приготовить ужин.\nПосле ужина они продолжили игру, теперь уже с большим энтузиазмом и страстью. В конце концов, победителем стала команда Тани, которая забила больше голов. Все закончилось веселым праздником и хорошими воспоминаниями о проведенном времени.\nНа следующий день Таня и Миша решили пригласить своих других друзей на игру. Они собрали всех в одном месте и провели ещё один захватывающий матч. Этот день также стал незабываемым благодаря новому мячу, который принес так много радости и улыбок.\nИтак, этот маленький мяч, который Таня нашла на поле, стал не просто предметом для игр, но и символом дружбы и веселья между детьми. Он помог им создать незабываемые моменты и укрепил их отношения.\nVersions\nv7:\n17e1bcc9c6d3e31852a95a168f7d3778f395cd2a\nOther name: saiga_llama3_8b_abliterated_sft_m11_d7_kto_m7_d7\nSFT dataset config: sft_d7.json\nSFT model config: saiga_llama3_8b_sft_m11.json\nKTO dataset config: pref_d7.json\nKTO model config: saiga_llama3_8b_kto_m7.json\nSFT wandb: link\nKTO wandb: link\nv6:\nb662833f247ca04f1843b356e7ff3ee4aef8086a\nOther name: saiga_llama3_8b_sft_m10_d1_kto_m2_d2\nSFT dataset config: sft_d1.json\nSFT model config: saiga_llama3_8b_sft_m10.json\nKTO dataset config: pref_d2.json\nKTO model config: saiga_llama3_8b_kto_m2.json\nSFT wandb: link\nKTO wandb: link\nv5:\nd947b00c56683cd4b2f7ce707edef89318027be4\nKTO-tune over v4, dataset: lmsys_clean_ru_preferences\nwandb link\nv4:\n1cc945d4ca2c7901cf989e7edaac52ab24f1a7dd\ndataset: saiga_scored, scores >= 8, c66032920556c0f21bbbed05e7e04433ec954c3d\nwandb link\nv3:\nc588356cd60bdee54d52c2dd5a2445acca8aa5c3\ndataset: saiga_scored, scores >= 8, d51cf8060bdc90023da8cf1c3f113f9193d6569b\nwandb link\nv2:\nae61b4f9b34fac9856d361ea78c66284a00e4f0b\ndataset code revision d0d123dd221e10bb2a3383bcb1c6e4efe1b4a28a\nwandb link\n5 datasets: ru_turbo_saiga, ru_sharegpt_cleaned, oasst1_ru_main_branch, gpt_roleplay_realm, ru_instruct_gpt4\nDatasets merging script: create_short_chat_set.py\nEvaluation\nDataset: https://github.com/IlyaGusev/rulm/blob/master/self_instruct/data/tasks.jsonl\nFramework: https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval\nEvaluator: alpaca_eval_cot_gpt4_turbo_fn\nPivot: chatgpt_3_5_turbo\nmodel\nlength_controlled_winrate\nwin_rate\nstandard_error\navg_length\nchatgpt_4_turbo\n76.04\n90.00\n1.46\n1270\nchatgpt_3_5_turbo\n50.00\n50.00\n0.00\n536\nsaiga_llama3_8b, v6\n49.33\n68.31\n2.26\n1262\nsfr-iter-dpo\n49.11\n74.94\n2.13\n1215\nsuzume\n49.05\n71.57\n2.20\n1325\nsaiga_llama3_8b, v7\n48.95\n69.40\n2.25\n1266\nsaiga_llama3_8b, v5\n47.13\n66.18\n2.31\n1194\nsaiga_llama3_8b, v4\n43.64\n65.90\n2.31\n1200\nsaiga_llama3_8b, v3\n36.97\n61.08\n2.38\n1162\nsaiga_llama3_8b, v2\n33.07\n48.19\n2.45\n1166\nsaiga_mistral_7b\n23.38\n35.99\n2.34\n949\nPivot: sfr\nmodel\nlength_controlled_winrate\nwin_rate\nstandard_error\navg_length\nsfr\n50.00\n50.00\n0.00\n1215\nsaiga_llama3_8b, v7\n48.95\n49.16\n2.46\n1266\nsaiga_llama3_8b, v6\n46.91\n47.23\n2.45\n1262\nsuzume_8b\n43.69\n48.19\n2.46\n1325"
