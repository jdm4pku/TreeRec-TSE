They were not built for, and will not work with, a Python Diffusers pipeline.  They need ml-stable-diffusion for command line use, or a Swift app that supports ControlNet, such as the (June 2023) MOCHI DIFFUSION 4.0 version.\nThe ControlNet models in this repo have both \"Original\" and \"Split-Einsum\" versions, all built for SD-1.5 type models.  They will not work with SD-2.1 type models.  The smaller zip files, with \"SE\", each have a single model for \"Split-Einsum\".  The larger zip files, without \"SE\", each have a set of \"Original\" models at 4 different resolutions.\nThe ControlNet model files are in the \"CN\" folder of this repo.  They are zipped and need to be unzipped after downloading.  The larger zips hold \"Original\" types at 512x512, 512x768, 768x512 and 768x768.  The smaller zips with \"SE\" have a single model for \"Split-Einsum\".\nIf you are using a GUI like MOCHI DIFFUSION  4.0, the app will most likely guide you to the correct location/arrangement for your ConrolNet model folder.\nPlease note that when you unzip the \"Originl\" ControlNet files (for example Canny.zip) from this repo, they will unzip into a folder, with the actual four model files inside that folder.  This folder is just a holding folder for the zipping process.  What you want to move into your ControlNet model folder in Mochi Diffusion will be the individual files, not the folder they unzip into.  The \"Split-Einsum\" zips just have a single file and don't use a holding folder.  To make things even more confusing, on some Mac systems, an individual ControlNet model file, for example Canny-5x5.mlmodelc, will appear in Finder as a folder, not a file.  You want to move the Canny-5x5.mlmodelc file or folder (and other .mlmodelc files or folders) into your ControlNet store folder.  Don't move the plain \"Canny\" folder.  This is different from base models, where you do want to be moving the folder that the downloaded zip file unzips into.  See the images here and here for an example of how my folders are set up for Mochi Diffusion.\nThe SD models (base models) linked at the bottom of this page were relocated from this repo to individual model repos at the CORE ML MODELS COMMUNITY repo.  The links will take you directly to each model.  They are for \"Original\" and \"Split-Einsum\".\nThe Stable Diffusion v1.5 model and the other SD 1.5 type models contain both the standard Unet and the ControlledUnet used for a ControlNet pipeline.  The correct one will be used automatically based on whether a ControlNet is enabled or not.\nThey have VAEEncoder.mlmodelc bundles that allow Image2Image to operate correctly at the noted resolutions, when used with a current Swift CLI pipeline or a current GUI built with ml-stable-diffusion 0.4.0 or ml-stable-diffusion 1.0.0, such as MOCHI DIFFUSION 4.0, or later.\nThe sizes noted for all model type inputs/outputs are WIDTH x HEIGHT.  A 512x768 is \"portrait\" orientation and a 768x512 is \"landscape\" orientation.\nThere is also a \"MISC\" folder at this repo that has text files with some notes and a screencap of my directory structure.  These are provided for those who want to convert models themselves and/or run the models with a SwiftCLI.  The notes are not perfect, and may be out of date if any of the Python or CoreML packages referenced have been updated recently.  You can open a Discussion here if you need help with any of the \"MISC\" items.\nNOTE: At present, it appears that the python_coreml_stable_diffusion  package from ml-stable-diffusion 6.3 is the latest version that will convert ControlNet models that work correctly.  Conversions with python_coreml_stable_diffusion 1.0.0, which is from ml-stable-diffusion 7.0b1 or 7.0b2, will throw errors when used.\nFor command line use, the \"MISC\" notes cover setting up a miniconda3 environment.  If you are using the command line, please read the notes concerning naming and placement of your ControlNet model folder.  Briefly, they will need to go inside a \"controlnet\" folder that you placed inside your base model folder.  You'll need a \"controlnet\" folder inside each base model folder, or a symlink named \"controlnet\" pointing to a central folder with all your ControlNet models inside it.\nIf you encounter any models in this repo that do not work correctly with ControlNet, using the current apple/ml-stable-diffusion SwiftCLI pipeline, or Mochi Diffusion 4.0, please leave a report in the Community Discussion area.  If you would like to add models that you have converted, leave a message there as well, and we will grant you access to the appropriate repo.\nControlNet Models - All Current SD-1.5-Type ControlNet Models\nEach larger zip file contains a set of 4 \"Original\" types at resolutions of 512x512, 512x768, 768x512 and 768x768.

The trained image prior model is then used to generate mCLIP image embeddings for input text prompts. Both the input text prompts and its mCLIP image embeddings are used in the diffusion process. A MoVQGAN model acts as the final block of the model, which decodes the latent representation into an actual image.\nDetails\nThe image prior training of the model was performed on the LAION Improved Aesthetics dataset, and then fine-tuning was performed on the LAION HighRes data.\nThe main Text2Image diffusion model was trained on the basis of 170M text-image pairs from the LAION HighRes dataset (an important condition was the presence of images with a resolution of at least 768x768). The use of 170M pairs is due to the fact that we kept the UNet diffusion block from Kandinsky 2.0, which allowed us not to train it from scratch.

It may not perform as well on questions outside the financial domain.\nPotential Bias: The model may reflect biases present in the training data. It is crucial to carefully evaluate and interpret the model's responses, particularly on sensitive topics such as investment advice or financial recommendations.\nConfidence and Verification: The model generates responses based on patterns learned from the training data, but it does not have inherent fact-checking capabilities. Users should verify the information provided by the model from reliable sources before making any financial decisions.\nTraining Data\nFinOPT-Franklin was trained on a financial question-answering dataset, which consists of questions and answers related to various financial topics. The dataset was collected from online sources and financial forums, and manually handcrafted.\nEthical Considerations\nWhen using FinOPT-Franklin, it is important to consider the following ethical considerations:\nPrivacy and Security: Avoid sharing sensitive personal or financial information while interacting with the model. The model does not have privacy safeguards, so exercise caution when discussing personal or confidential matters.\nFairness and Bias: The model's responses may reflect biases present in the training data. Be aware of potential biases and make an effort to evaluate responses critically and fairly.\nTransparency: The model operates as a predictive text generator based on patterns learned from the training data. The model's inner workings and the specific training data used are proprietary and not publicly available.\nUser Responsibility: Users should take responsibility\nfor their own financial decisions and not solely rely on the information provided by the model. Consult with financial professionals or reliable sources for specific financial advice or recommendations.\nFurther Information\nFor additional information or inquiries about FinOPT-Franklin, please contact the Maya Philippines iOps Team via jasper.catapang@maya.ph.\nDisclaimer\nFinOPT-Franklin is an AI language model trained by Maya Philippines.

Let's look at a simple example.\nFirst, we install transformers and some other libraries\npip install torch accelerate torchaudio datasets\npip install --upgrade transformers\nNote: In order to use MMS you need to have at least transformers >= 4.30 installed. If the 4.30 version\nis not yet available on PyPI make sure to install transformers from\nsource:\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\nNext, we load a couple of audio samples via datasets. Make sure that the audio data is sampled to 16000 kHz.\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, Audio\n# English\nstream_data = load_dataset(\"mozilla-foundation/common_voice_13_0\", \"en\", split=\"test\", streaming=True)\nstream_data = stream_data.cast_column(\"audio\", Audio(sampling_rate=16000))\nen_sample = next(iter(stream_data))[\"audio\"][\"array\"]\n# French\nstream_data = load_dataset(\"mozilla-foundation/common_voice_13_0\", \"fr\", split=\"test\", streaming=True)\nstream_data = stream_data.cast_column(\"audio\", Audio(sampling_rate=16000))\nfr_sample = next(iter(stream_data))[\"audio\"][\"array\"]\nNext, we load the model and processor\nfrom transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC, AutoProcessor\nimport torch\nmodel_id = \"facebook/mms-1b-all\"\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained(model_id)\nNow we process the audio data, pass the processed audio data to the model and transcribe the model output, just like we usually do for Wav2Vec2 models such as facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h\ninputs = processor(en_sample, sampling_rate=16_000, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nwith torch.no_grad():\noutputs = model(**inputs).logits\nids = torch.argmax(outputs, dim=-1)[0]\ntranscription = processor.decode(ids)\n# 'joe keton disapproved of films and buster also had reservations about the media'\nWe can now keep the same model in memory and simply switch out the language adapters by calling the convenient load_adapter() function for the model and set_target_lang() for the tokenizer. We pass the target language as an input - \"fra\" for French.\nprocessor.tokenizer.set_target_lang(\"fra\")\nmodel.load_adapter(\"fra\")\ninputs = processor(fr_sample, sampling_rate=16_000, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nwith torch.no_grad():\noutputs = model(**inputs).logits\nids = torch.argmax(outputs, dim=-1)[0]\ntranscription = processor.decode(ids)\n# \"ce dernier est volé tout au long de l'histoire romaine\"\nIn the same way the language can be switched out for all other supported languages.

The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: {prompt} ASSISTANT:\nProvided files and GPTQ parameters\nMultiple quantisation parameters are provided, to allow you to choose the best one for your hardware and requirements.\nEach separate quant is in a different branch.  See below for instructions on fetching from different branches.\nAll recent GPTQ files are made with AutoGPTQ, and all files in non-main branches are made with AutoGPTQ. Files in the main branch which were uploaded before August 2023 were made with GPTQ-for-LLaMa.\nExplanation of GPTQ parameters\nBits: The bit size of the quantised model.\nGS: GPTQ group size. Higher numbers use less VRAM, but have lower quantisation accuracy. \"None\" is the lowest possible value.\nAct Order: True or False. Also known as desc_act. True results in better quantisation accuracy. Some GPTQ clients have had issues with models that use Act Order plus Group Size, but this is generally resolved now.\nDamp %: A GPTQ parameter that affects how samples are processed for quantisation. 0.01 is default, but 0.1 results in slightly better accuracy.\nGPTQ dataset: The dataset used for quantisation. Using a dataset more appropriate to the model's training can improve quantisation accuracy. Note that the GPTQ dataset is not the same as the dataset used to train the model - please refer to the original model repo for details of the training dataset(s).\nSequence Length: The length of the dataset sequences used for quantisation. Ideally this is the same as the model sequence length. For some very long sequence models (16+K), a lower sequence length may have to be used.  Note that a lower sequence length does not limit the sequence length of the quantised model. It only impacts the quantisation accuracy on longer inference sequences.\nExLlama Compatibility: Whether this file can be loaded with ExLlama, which currently only supports Llama models in 4-bit.\nBranch\nBits\nGS\nAct Order\nDamp %\nGPTQ Dataset\nSeq Len\nSize\nExLlama\nDesc\nmain\n4\nNone\nYes\n0.01\nwikitext\n2048\n16.94 GB\nYes\n4-bit, with Act Order.

The LDM3D model is fine-tuned on a dataset of tuples containing an RGB image, depth map and caption, and validated through extensive experiments. We also develop an application called DepthFusion, which uses the img2img pipeline to create immersive and interactive 360-degree-view experiences using TouchDesigner. This technology has the potential to transform a wide range of industries, from entertainment and gaming to architecture and design. Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of generative AI and computer vision, and showcases the potential of LDM3D and DepthFusion to revolutionize content creation and digital experiences.\nLDM3D overview taken from the LDM3D paper.\nUsage\nYou can use this model to generate an RGB image and depth map given a text prompt.\nA short video summarizing the approach can be found at this url and a VR demo can be found here.\nA demo is also accessible on Spaces.\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch on both a CPU and GPU architecture:\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionLDM3DPipeline\npipe = StableDiffusionLDM3DPipeline.from_pretrained(\"Intel/ldm3d\")\n# On CPU\npipe.to(\"cpu\")\n# On GPU\npipe.to(\"cuda\")\nprompt = \"A picture of some lemons on a table\"\nname = \"lemons\"\noutput = pipe(prompt)\nrgb_image, depth_image = output.rgb, output.depth\nrgb_image[0].save(name+\"_ldm3d_rgb.jpg\")\ndepth_image[0].save(name+\"_ldm3d_depth.png\")\nThis is the result:\nTraining data\nThe LDM3D model was finetuned on a dataset constructed from a subset of the LAION-400M dataset, a large-scale image-caption dataset that contains over 400 million image-caption pairs.\nFinetuning\nThe fine-tuning process comprises two stages. In the first stage, we train an autoencoder to generate a lower-dimensional, perceptually equivalent data representation. Subsequently, we fine-tune the diffusion model using the frozen autoencoder\nEvaluation results\nQuantitative results\nThe table below shows the quantitative results of text-conditional image synthesis on the 512 x 512-sized MS-COCO dataset with 50 DDIM steps.\nMethod\nFID ↓\nIS ↑\nCLIP ↑\nSD v1.4\n28.08\n34.17 ± 0.76\n26.13 ± 2.81\nSD v1.5\n27.39\n34.02 ± 0.79\n26.13 ± 2.79\nLDM3D (ours)\n27.82\n28.79 ± 0.49\n26.61 ± 2.92\nOur model is on par with the Stable Diffusion models with the same number of parameters (1.06B).

The model comes in different sizes: 7B, 13B, 33B and 65B parameters.\nPaper or resources for more information\nMore information can be found in the paper “LLaMA, Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models”, available at https://research.facebook.com/publications/llama-open-and-efficient-foundation-language-models/.\nCitations details\nhttps://research.facebook.com/publications/llama-open-and-efficient-foundation-language-models/\nLicense\nNon-commercial bespoke license\nWhere to send questions or comments about the model\nQuestions and comments about LLaMA can be sent via the GitHub repository of the project , by opening an issue.\nIntended use\nPrimary intended uses\nThe primary use of LLaMA is research on large language models, including:\nexploring potential applications such as question answering, natural language understanding or reading comprehension,\nunderstanding capabilities and limitations of current language models, and developing techniques to improve those,\nevaluating and mitigating biases, risks, toxic and harmful content generations, hallucinations.\nPrimary intended users\nThe primary intended users of the model are researchers in natural language processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nOut-of-scope use cases\nLLaMA is a base, or foundational, model. As such, it should not be used on downstream applications without further risk evaluation and mitigation. In particular, our model has not been trained with human feedback, and can thus generate toxic or offensive content, incorrect information or generally unhelpful answers.\nFactors\nRelevant factors\nOne of the most relevant factors for which model performance may vary is which language is used. Although we included 20 languages in the training data, most of our dataset is made of English text, and we thus expect the model to perform better for English than other languages. Relatedly, it has been shown in previous studies that performance might vary for different dialects, and we expect that it will be the case for our model.\nEvaluation factors\nAs our model is trained on data from the Web, we expect that it reflects biases from this source. We thus evaluated on RAI datasets to measure biases exhibited by the model for gender, religion, race, sexual orientation, age, nationality, disability, physical appearance and socio-economic status. We also measure the toxicity of model generations, depending on the toxicity of the context used to prompt the model.\nMetrics\nModel performance measures\nWe use the following measure to evaluate the model:\nAccuracy for common sense reasoning, reading comprehension, natural language understanding (MMLU), BIG-bench hard, WinoGender and CrowS-Pairs,\nExact match for question answering,\nThe toxicity score from Perspective API on RealToxicityPrompts.\nDecision thresholds\nNot applicable.\nApproaches to uncertainty and variability\nDue to the high computational requirements of training LLMs, we trained only one model of each size, and thus could not evaluate variability of pre-training.\nEvaluation datasets\nThe model was evaluated on the following benchmarks: BoolQ, PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC, OpenBookQA, NaturalQuestions, TriviaQA, RACE, MMLU, BIG-bench hard, GSM8k, RealToxicityPrompts, WinoGender, CrowS-Pairs.\nTraining dataset\nThe model was trained using the following source of data: CCNet [67%], C4 [15%], GitHub [4.5%], Wikipedia [4.5%], Books [4.5%], ArXiv [2.5%], Stack Exchange[2%]. The Wikipedia and Books domains include data in the following languages: bg, ca, cs, da, de, en, es, fr, hr, hu, it, nl, pl, pt, ro, ru, sl, sr, sv, uk.

As such, it contains offensive, harmful and biased content. We thus expect the model to exhibit such biases from the training data.\nHuman life\nThe model is not intended to inform decisions about matters central to human life, and should not be used in such a way.\nMitigations\nWe filtered the data from the Web based on its proximity to Wikipedia text and references. For this, we used a Kneser-Ney language model and a fastText linear classifier.\nRisks and harms\nRisks and harms of large language models include the generation of harmful, offensive or biased content. These models are often prone to generating incorrect information, sometimes referred to as hallucinations. We do not expect our model to be an exception in this regard.\nUse cases\nLLaMA is a foundational model, and as such, it should not be used for downstream applications without further investigation and mitigations of risks.

In a transformer model, the attention mechanism works by computing a weighted sum of the input vectors and then applying a non-linear activation function to the result.\nThe attention mechanism in a transformer model works in two steps:\n1. Query-Key Mapping: First, the input sequence is divided into two parts: the query vector and the key vector. The query vector represents the input at the current position, and the key vector represents the input at a previous position.\n2. Attention Weight Calculation: Second, the attention weights are calculated using the dot product between the query vector and each key vector. The attention weights represent the importance of the input at the previous position to the current position.\nThe attention weights are then used to compute the attention score for each input element. The attention score represents the relevance of the input element to the current position.\nThe attention mechanism in a transformer model is designed to capture global dependencies between different parts of the input. By attending to input elements from different positions, the model can learn to understand the relationships between different parts of the input. This allows the model to perform more complex tasks, such as understanding the relationships between words in a sentence or pixels in an image.</s>\n'''\nFinetuning details\nThe finetuning scripts will be available in our RAIL Github Repository\nOpen LLM Leaderboard Evaluation Results\nDetailed results can be found here\nMetric\nValue\nAvg.\n40.9\nARC (25-shot)\n49.74\nHellaSwag (10-shot)\n73.67\nMMLU (5-shot)\n31.52\nTruthfulQA (0-shot)\n34.65\nWinogrande (5-shot)\n65.43\nGSM8K (5-shot)\n0.53\nDROP (3-shot)\n30.75",

The model should not be used to intentionally create or disseminate music pieces that create hostile or alienating environments for people. This includes generating music that people would foreseeably find disturbing, distressing, or offensive; or content that propagates historical or current stereotypes.\nMetrics\nModels performance measures: We used the following objective measure to evaluate the model on a standard music benchmark:\nFrechet Audio Distance computed on features extracted from a pre-trained audio classifier (VGGish)\nKullback-Leibler Divergence on label distributions extracted from a pre-trained audio classifier (PaSST)\nCLAP Score between audio embedding and text embedding extracted from a pre-trained CLAP model\nAdditionally, we run qualitative studies with human participants, evaluating the performance of the model with the following axes:\nOverall quality of the music samples;\nText relevance to the provided text input;\nAdherence to the melody for melody-guided music generation.\nMore details on performance measures and human studies can be found in the paper.\nDecision thresholds: Not applicable.\nEvaluation datasets\nThe model was evaluated on the MusicCaps benchmark and on an in-domain held-out evaluation set, with no artist overlap with the training set.\nTraining datasets\nThe model was trained on licensed data using the following sources: the Meta Music Initiative Sound Collection, Shutterstock music collection and the Pond5 music collection. See the paper for more details about the training set and corresponding preprocessing.\nEvaluation results\nBelow are the objective metrics obtained on MusicCaps with the released model. Note that for the publicly released models, we had all the datasets go through a state-of-the-art music source separation method, namely using the open source Hybrid Transformer for Music Source Separation (HT-Demucs), in order to keep only the instrumental part.

The model is trained on 20K hours of data, we believe that scaling the model on larger datasets can further improve the performance of the model.\nMitigations: Vocals have been removed from the data source using corresponding tags, and then using a state-of-the-art music source separation method, namely using the open source Hybrid Transformer for Music Source Separation (HT-Demucs).\nLimitations:\nThe model is not able to generate realistic vocals.\nThe model has been trained with English descriptions and will not perform as well in other languages.\nThe model does not perform equally well for all music styles and cultures.\nThe model sometimes generates end of songs, collapsing to silence.\nIt is sometimes difficult to assess what types of text descriptions provide the best generations. Prompt engineering may be required to obtain satisfying results.\nBiases: The source of data is potentially lacking diversity and all music cultures are not equally represented in the dataset. The model may not perform equally well on the wide variety of music genres that exists. The generated samples from the model will reflect the biases from the training data. Further work on this model should include methods for balanced and just representations of cultures, for example, by scaling the training data to be both diverse and inclusive.\nRisks and harms: Biases and limitations of the model may lead to generation of samples that may be considered as biased, inappropriate or offensive. We believe that providing the code to reproduce the research and train new models will allow to broaden the application to new and more representative data.\nUse cases: Users must be aware of the biases, limitations and risks of the model. MusicGen is a model developed for artificial intelligence research on controllable music generation. As such, it should not be used for downstream applications without further investigation and mitigation of risks.",

It introduces a streaming encoder-decoder architecture with quantized latent space, trained in an end-to-end fashion.\nThe model simplifies and speeds up training using a single multiscale spectrogram adversary that efficiently reduces artifacts and produces high-quality samples.\nIt also includes a novel loss balancer mechanism that stabilizes training by decoupling the choice of hyperparameters from the typical scale of the loss.\nAdditionally, lightweight Transformer models are used to further compress the obtained representation while maintaining real-time performance.\nDeveloped by: Meta AI\nModel type: Audio Codec\nModel Sources\nRepository: GitHub Repository\nPaper: EnCodec: End-to-End Neural Audio Codec\nUses\nDirect Use\nEnCodec can be used directly as an audio codec for real-time compression and decompression of audio signals.\nIt provides high-quality audio compression and efficient decoding. The model was trained on various bandwiths, which can be specified when encoding (compressing) and decoding (decompressing).\nTwo different setup exist for EnCodec:\nNon-streamable: the input audio is split into chunks of 1 seconds, with an overlap of 10 ms, which are then encoded.\nStreamable: weight normalizationis used on the convolution layers, and the input is not split into chunks but rather padded on the left.\nDownstream Use\nEnCodec can be fine-tuned for specific audio tasks or integrated into larger audio processing pipelines for applications such as speech generation,\nmusic generation, or text to speech tasks.\n[More Information Needed]\nHow to Get Started with the Model\nUse the following code to get started with the EnCodec model using a dummy example from the LibriSpeech dataset (~9MB). First, install the required Python packages:\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --upgrade datasets[audio]\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git@main\nThen load an audio sample, and run a forward pass of the model:\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, Audio\nfrom transformers import EncodecModel, AutoProcessor\n# load a demonstration datasets\nlibrispeech_dummy = load_dataset(\"hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\n# load the model + processor (for pre-processing the audio)\nmodel = EncodecModel.from_pretrained(\"facebook/encodec_24khz\")\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"facebook/encodec_24khz\")\n# cast the audio data to the correct sampling rate for the model\nlibrispeech_dummy = librispeech_dummy.cast_column(\"audio\", Audio(sampling_rate=processor.sampling_rate))\naudio_sample = librispeech_dummy[0][\"audio\"][\"array\"]\n# pre-process the inputs\ninputs = processor(raw_audio=audio_sample, sampling_rate=processor.sampling_rate, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n# explicitly encode then decode the audio inputs\nencoder_outputs = model.encode(inputs[\"input_values\"], inputs[\"padding_mask\"])\naudio_values = model.decode(encoder_outputs.audio_codes, encoder_outputs.audio_scales, inputs[\"padding_mask\"])[0]\n# or the equivalent with a forward pass\naudio_values = model(inputs[\"input_values\"], inputs[\"padding_mask\"]).audio_values\nTraining Details\nThe model was trained for 300 epochs, with one epoch being 2,000 updates with the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 64 examples of 1 second each, a learning rate of 3 · 10−4\n, β1 = 0.5, and β2 = 0.9. All the models are traind using 8 A100 GPUs.\nTraining Data\nFor speech:\nDNS Challenge 4\nCommon Voice\nFor general audio:\nAudioSet\nFSD50K\nFor music:\nJamendo dataset\nThey used four different training strategies to sample for these datasets:\n(s1) sample a single source from Jamendo with probability 0.32;\n(s2) sample a single source from the other datasets with the same probability;\n(s3) mix two sources from all datasets with a probability of 0.24;\n(s4) mix three sources from all datasets except music with a probability of 0.12.\nThe audio is normalized by file and a random gain between -10 and 6 dB id applied.\nEvaluation\nSubjectif metric for restoration:\nThis models was evalutated using the MUSHRA protocol (Series, 2014), using both a hidden reference and a low anchor. Annotators were recruited using a\ncrowd-sourcing platform, in which they were asked to rate the perceptual quality of the provided samples in\na range between 1 to 100. They randomly select 50 samples of 5 seconds from each category of the the test set\nand force at least 10 annotations per samples. To filter noisy annotations and outliers we remove annotators\nwho rate the reference recordings less then 90 in at least 20% of the cases, or rate the low-anchor recording\nabove 80 more than 50% of the time.\nObjective metric for restoration:\nThe ViSQOL()ink) metric was used together with the Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Noise Ration (SI-SNR) (Luo & Mesgarani, 2019;\nNachmani et al., 2020; Chazan et al., 2021).\nResults\nThe results of the evaluation demonstrate the superiority of EnCodec compared to the baselines across different bandwidths (1.5, 3, 6, and 12 kbps).\nWhen comparing EnCodec with the baselines at the same bandwidth, EnCodec consistently outperforms them in terms of MUSHRA score.\nNotably, EnCodec achieves better performance, on average, at 3 kbps compared to Lyra-v2 at 6 kbps and Opus at 12 kbps.\nAdditionally, by incorporating the language model over the codes, it is possible to achieve a bandwidth reduction of approximately 25-40%.\nFor example, the bandwidth of the 3 kbps model can be reduced to 1.9 kbps.\nSummary\nEnCodec is a state-of-the-art real-time neural audio compression model that excels in producing high-fidelity audio samples at various sample rates and bandwidths.\nThe model's performance was evaluated across different settings, ranging from 24kHz monophonic at 1.5 kbps to 48kHz stereophonic, showcasing both subjective and\nobjective results. Notably, EnCodec incorporates a novel spectrogram-only adversarial loss, effectively reducing artifacts and enhancing sample quality.\nTraining stability and interpretability were further enhanced through the introduction of a gradient balancer for the loss weights.\nAdditionally, the study demonstrated that a compact Transformer model can be employed to achieve an additional bandwidth reduction of up to 40% without compromising\nquality, particularly in applications where low latency is not critical (e.g., music streaming).\nCitation\nBibTeX:\n@misc{défossez2022high,\ntitle={High Fidelity Neural Audio Compression},\nauthor={Alexandre Défossez and Jade Copet and Gabriel Synnaeve and Yossi Adi},\nyear={2022},\neprint={2210.13438},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={eess.AS}\n}",

The trained image prior model is then used to generate mCLIP image embeddings for input text prompts. Both the input text prompts and its mCLIP image embeddings are used in the diffusion process. A MoVQGAN model acts as the final block of the model, which decodes the latent representation into an actual image.\nDetails\nThe image prior training of the model was performed on the LAION Improved Aesthetics dataset, and then fine-tuning was performed on the LAION HighRes data.\nThe main Text2Image diffusion model was trained on the basis of 170M text-image pairs from the LAION HighRes dataset (an important condition was the presence of images with a resolution of at least 768x768). The use of 170M pairs is due to the fact that we kept the UNet diffusion block from Kandinsky 2.0, which allowed us not to train it from scratch. Further, at the stage of fine-tuning, a dataset of 2M very high-quality high-resolution images with descriptions (COYO, anime, landmarks_russia, and a number of others) was used separately collected from open sources.\nEvaluation\nWe quantitatively measure the performance of Kandinsky 2.1 on the COCO_30k dataset, in zero-shot mode.
