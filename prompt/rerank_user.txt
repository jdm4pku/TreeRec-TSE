Given a user requirement and a list of candidate artifacts,
rank the artifacts from best match to worst match accord-
ing to how well each artifact satisfies the requirement.
User Requirements: {query}
Candidate Artifacts: {context}

Please re-rank the artifacts from most relevant to least relevant according to how well each artifact satisfies the user's intent.

Output the result strictly in **JSON format**, with the following structure:

{{
  "reranked_artifacts": ["artifact_name_1", "artifact_name_2", "artifact_name_3", ...]
}}

Do not include explanations, scores, or any additional text outside the JSON object.
